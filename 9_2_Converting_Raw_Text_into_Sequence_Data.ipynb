              "'The Time Machine, by H. G. Wells [1898]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\n\\nThe Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him)\\nwas expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and\\ntwinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The\\nfire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent\\nlights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and\\npassed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and\\ncaressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that\\nluxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought roams gracefully\\nfree of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this\\nway--marking the points with a lean forefinger--as we sat and lazily\\nadmired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it)\\nand his fecundity.\\n\\n\\'You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two\\nideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for\\ninstance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.\\'\\n\\n\\'Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?\\'\\nsaid Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.\\n\\n\\'I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable\\nground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You\\nknow of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_,\\nhas no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a\\nmathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.\\'\\n\\n\\'That is all right,\\' said the Psychologist.\\n\\n\\'Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a\\nreal existence.\\'\\n\\n\\'There I object,\\' said Filby. \\'Of course a solid body may exist. All\\nreal things--\\'\\n\\n\\'So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_\\ncube exist?\\'\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t follow you,\\' said Filby.\\n\\n\\'Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real\\nexistence?\\'\\n\\nFilby became pensive. \\'Clearly,\\' the Time Traveller proceeded, \\'any\\nreal body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have\\nLength, Breadth, Thickness, and--Duration. But through a natural\\ninfirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we\\nincline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions,\\nthree which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time.\\nThere is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between\\nthe former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that\\nour consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the\\nlatter from the beginning to the end of our lives.\\'\\n\\n\\'That,\\' said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight\\nhis cigar over the lamp; \\'that ... very clear indeed.\\'\\n\\n\\'Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,\\'\\ncontinued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of\\ncheerfulness. \\'Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension,\\nthough some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know\\nthey mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. _There is\\nno difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space\\nexcept that our consciousness moves along it_. But some foolish\\npeople have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all\\nheard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?\\'\\n\\n\\'_I_ have not,\\' said the Provincial Mayor.\\n\\n\\'It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is\\nspoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,\\nBreadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to\\nthree planes, each at right angles to the others. But some\\nphilosophical people have been asking why _three_ dimensions\\nparticularly--why not another direction at right angles to the other\\nthree?--and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimension geometry.\\nProfessor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York\\nMathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know how on a flat\\nsurface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of\\na three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models\\nof three dimensions they could represent one of four--if they could\\nmaster the perspective of the thing. See?\\'\\n\\n\\'I think so,\\' murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his\\nbrows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one\\nwho repeats mystic words. \\'Yes, I think I see it now,\\' he said after\\nsome time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.\\n\\n\\'Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this\\ngeometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results\\nare curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight\\nyears old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at\\ntwenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it\\nwere, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned\\nbeing, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.\\n\\n\\'Scientific people,\\' proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause\\nrequired for the proper assimilation of this, \\'know very well that\\nTime is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram,\\na weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the\\nmovement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night\\nit fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to\\nhere. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the\\ndimensions of Space generally recognized? But certainly it traced\\nsuch a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude was along\\nthe Time-Dimension.\\'\\n\\n\\'But,\\' said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, \\'if\\nTime is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why\\nhas it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot\\nwe move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?\\'\\n\\nThe Time Traveller smiled. \\'Are you sure we can move freely in\\nSpace? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,\\nand men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two\\ndimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.\\'\\n\\n\\'Not exactly,\\' said the Medical Man. \\'There are balloons.\\'\\n\\n\\'But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the\\ninequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical\\nmovement.\\'\\n\\n\\'Still they could move a little up and down,\\' said the Medical Man.\\n\\n\\'Easier, far easier down than up.\\'\\n\\n\\'And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the\\npresent moment.\\'\\n\\n\\'My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where\\nthe whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the\\npresent moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have\\nno dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform\\nvelocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_\\nif we began our existence fifty miles above the earth\\'s surface.\\'\\n\\n\\'But the great difficulty is this,\\' interrupted the Psychologist.\\n\\'You _can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot\\nmove about in Time.\\'\\n\\n\\'That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say\\nthat we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling\\nan incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence:\\nI become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of\\ncourse we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any\\nmore than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the\\nground. But a civilized man is better off than the savage in this\\nrespect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why\\nshould he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or\\naccelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about\\nand travel the other way?\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, _this_,\\' began Filby, \\'is all--\\'\\n\\n\\'Why not?\\' said the Time Traveller.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s against reason,\\' said Filby.\\n\\n\\'What reason?\\' said the Time Traveller.\\n\\n\\'You can show black is white by argument,\\' said Filby, \\'but you will\\nnever convince me.\\'\\n\\n\\'Possibly not,\\' said the Time Traveller. \\'But now you begin to see\\nthe object of my investigations into the geometry of Four\\nDimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine--\\'\\n\\n\\'To travel through Time!\\' exclaimed the Very Young Man.\\n\\n\\'That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time,\\nas the driver determines.\\'\\n\\nFilby contented himself with laughter.\\n\\n\\'But I have experimental verification,\\' said the Time Traveller.\\n\\n\\'It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,\\' the\\nPsychologist suggested. \\'One might travel back and verify the\\naccepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!\\'\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t you think you would attract attention?\\' said the Medical Man.\\n\\'Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.\\'\\n\\n\\'One might get one\\'s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,\\'\\nthe Very Young Man thought.\\n\\n\\'In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go.\\nThe German scholars have improved Greek so much.\\'\\n\\n\\'Then there is the future,\\' said the Very Young Man. \\'Just think!\\nOne might invest all one\\'s money, leave it to accumulate at\\ninterest, and hurry on ahead!\\'\\n\\n\\'To discover a society,\\' said I, \\'erected on a strictly communistic\\nbasis.\\'\\n\\n\\'Of all the wild extravagant theories!\\' began the Psychologist.\\n\\n\\'Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until--\\'\\n\\n\\'Experimental verification!\\' cried I. \\'You are going to verify\\n_that_?\\'\\n\\n\\'The experiment!\\' cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.\\n\\n\\'Let\\'s see your experiment anyhow,\\' said the Psychologist, \\'though\\nit\\'s all humbug, you know.\\'\\n\\nThe Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly,\\nand with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly\\nout of the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long\\npassage to his laboratory.\\n\\nThe Psychologist looked at us. \\'I wonder what he\\'s got?\\'\\n\\n\\'Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,\\' said the Medical Man, and\\nFilby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at Burslem; but\\nbefore he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and\\nFilby\\'s anecdote collapsed.\\n\\nThe thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering\\nmetallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very\\ndelicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent\\ncrystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that\\nfollows--unless his explanation is to be accepted--is an absolutely\\nunaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables that\\nwere scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with\\ntwo legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism.\\nThen he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the\\ntable was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon\\nthe model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in\\nbrass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that\\nthe room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair\\nnearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between\\nthe Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking\\nover his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched\\nhim in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. The\\nVery Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the\\nalert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however\\nsubtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played\\nupon us under these conditions.\\n\\nThe Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. \\'Well?\\'\\nsaid the Psychologist.\\n\\n\\'This little affair,\\' said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows\\nupon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus,\\n\\'is only a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through\\ntime. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there\\nis an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in\\nsome way unreal.\\' He pointed to the part with his finger. \\'Also,\\nhere is one little white lever, and here is another.\\'\\n\\nThe Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.\\n\\'It\\'s beautifully made,\\' he said.\\n\\n\\'It took two years to make,\\' retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when\\nwe had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: \\'Now I\\nwant you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over,\\nsends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses\\nthe motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller.\\nPresently I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will\\ngo. It will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a\\ngood look at the thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy\\nyourselves there is no trickery. I don\\'t want to waste this model,\\nand then be told I\\'m a quack.\\'\\n\\nThere was a minute\\'s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to\\nspeak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth\\nhis finger towards the lever. \\'No,\\' he said suddenly. \\'Lend me your\\nhand.\\' And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual\\'s\\nhand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it\\nwas the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine\\non its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am\\nabsolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of\\nwind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel\\nwas blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, became\\nindistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of\\nfaintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone--vanished! Save\\nfor the lamp the table was bare.\\n\\nEveryone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.\\n\\nThe Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked\\nunder the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully.\\n\\'Well?\\' he said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then,\\ngetting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his\\nback to us began to fill his pipe.\\n\\nWe stared at each other. \\'Look here,\\' said the Medical Man, \\'are you\\nin earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine\\nhas travelled into time?\\'\\n\\n\\'Certainly,\\' said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at\\nthe fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the\\nPsychologist\\'s face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not\\nunhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.)\\n\\'What is more, I have a big machine nearly finished in there\\'--he\\nindicated the laboratory--\\'and when that is put together I mean to\\nhave a journey on my own account.\\'\\n\\n\\'You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?\\'\\nsaid Filby.\\n\\n\\'Into the future or the past--I don\\'t, for certain, know which.\\'\\n\\nAfter an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. \\'It must have\\ngone into the past if it has gone anywhere,\\' he said.\\n\\n\\'Why?\\' said the Time Traveller.\\n\\n\\'Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it\\ntravelled into the future it would still be here all this time,\\nsince it must have travelled through this time.\\'\\n\\n\\'But,\\' I said, \\'If it travelled into the past it would have been\\nvisible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we\\nwere here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!\\'\\n\\n\\'Serious objections,\\' remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of\\nimpartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.\\n\\n\\'Not a bit,\\' said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: \\'You\\nthink. You can explain that. It\\'s presentation below the threshold,\\nyou know, diluted presentation.\\'\\n\\n\\'Of course,\\' said the Psychologist, and reassured us. \\'That\\'s a\\nsimple point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It\\'s plain\\nenough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor\\ncan we appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of\\na wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is\\ntravelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than\\nwe are, if it gets through a minute while we get through a second,\\nthe impression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or\\none-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in\\ntime. That\\'s plain enough.\\' He passed his hand through the space in\\nwhich the machine had been. \\'You see?\\' he said, laughing.\\n\\nWe sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the\\nTime Traveller asked us what we thought of it all.\\n\\n\\'It sounds plausible enough to-night,\\' said the Medical Man; \\'but\\nwait until to-morrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.\\'\\n\\n\\'Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?\\' asked the Time\\nTraveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the\\nway down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember\\nvividly the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette,\\nthe dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but\\nincredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger\\nedition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before\\nour eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly\\nbeen filed or sawn out of rock crystal. The thing was generally\\ncomplete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the\\nbench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a better\\nlook at it. Quartz it seemed to be.\\n\\n\\'Look here,\\' said the Medical Man, \\'are you perfectly serious?\\nOr is this a trick--like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?\\'\\n\\n\\'Upon that machine,\\' said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp\\naloft, \\'I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more\\nserious in my life.\\'\\n\\nNone of us quite knew how to take it.\\n\\nI caught Filby\\'s eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he\\nwinked at me solemnly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\n\\nI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time\\nMachine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who\\nare too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round\\nhim; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in\\nambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and\\nexplained the matter in the Time Traveller\\'s words, we should have\\nshown _him_ far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his\\nmotives; a pork butcher could understand Filby. But the Time\\nTraveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we\\ndistrusted him. Things that would have made the frame of a less\\nclever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things\\ntoo easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt\\nquite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting\\ntheir reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a\\nnursery with egg-shell china. So I don\\'t think any of us said very\\nmuch about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and\\nthe next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of\\nour minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness,\\nthe curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it\\nsuggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the\\ntrick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man,\\nwhom I met on Friday at the Linnaean. He said he had seen a similar\\nthing at Tubingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing out\\nof the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain.\\n\\nThe next Thursday I went again to Richmond--I suppose I was one of\\nthe Time Traveller\\'s most constant guests--and, arriving late, found\\nfour or five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical\\nMan was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand\\nand his watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller,\\nand--\\'It\\'s half-past seven now,\\' said the Medical Man. \\'I suppose\\nwe\\'d better have dinner?\\'\\n\\n\\'Where\\'s----?\\' said I, naming our host.\\n\\n\\'You\\'ve just come? It\\'s rather odd. He\\'s unavoidably detained. He\\nasks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he\\'s not\\nback. Says he\\'ll explain when he comes.\\'\\n\\n\\'It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,\\' said the Editor of a\\nwell-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.\\n\\nThe Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself\\nwho had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the\\nEditor aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another--a quiet,\\nshy man with a beard--whom I didn\\'t know, and who, as far as my\\nobservation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was\\nsome speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller\\'s\\nabsence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit.\\nThe Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist\\nvolunteered a wooden account of the \\'ingenious paradox and trick\\' we\\nhad witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition\\nwhen the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I\\nwas facing the door, and saw it first. \\'Hallo!\\' I said. \\'At last!\\'\\nAnd the door opened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us.\\nI gave a cry of surprise. \\'Good heavens! man, what\\'s the matter?\\'\\ncried the Medical Man, who saw him next. And the whole tableful\\nturned towards the door.\\n\\nHe was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and\\nsmeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it\\nseemed to me greyer--either with dust and dirt or because its colour\\nhad actually faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown\\ncut on it--a cut half healed; his expression was haggard and drawn,\\nas by intense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway,\\nas if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room.\\nHe walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps.\\nWe stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak.\\n\\nHe said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a\\nmotion towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and\\npushed it towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good:\\nfor he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old smile\\nflickered across his face. \\'What on earth have you been up to, man?\\'\\nsaid the Doctor. The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. \\'Don\\'t let\\nme disturb you,\\' he said, with a certain faltering articulation.\\n\\'I\\'m all right.\\' He stopped, held out his glass for more, and took\\nit off at a draught. \\'That\\'s good,\\' he said. His eyes grew brighter,\\nand a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance flickered over\\nour faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warm\\nand comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were feeling\\nhis way among his words. \\'I\\'m going to wash and dress, and then I\\'ll\\ncome down and explain things ... Save me some of that mutton. I\\'m\\nstarving for a bit of meat.\\'\\n\\nHe looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he\\nwas all right. The Editor began a question. \\'Tell you presently,\\'\\nsaid the Time Traveller. \\'I\\'m--funny! Be all right in a minute.\\'\\n\\nHe put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again\\nI remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall,\\nand standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had\\nnothing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the\\ndoor closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered\\nhow he detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my\\nmind was wool-gathering. Then, \\'Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent\\nScientist,\\' I heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in\\nheadlines. And this brought my attention back to the bright\\ndinner-table.\\n\\n\\'What\\'s the game?\\' said the Journalist. \\'Has he been doing the\\nAmateur Cadger? I don\\'t follow.\\' I met the eye of the Psychologist,\\nand read my own interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time\\nTraveller limping painfully upstairs. I don\\'t think any one else had\\nnoticed his lameness.\\n\\nThe first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical\\nMan, who rang the bell--the Time Traveller hated to have servants\\nwaiting at dinner--for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his\\nknife and fork with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The\\ndinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little while,\\nwith gaps of wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his\\ncuriosity. \\'Does our friend eke out his modest income with a\\ncrossing? or has he his Nebuchadnezzar phases?\\' he inquired. \\'I feel\\nassured it\\'s this business of the Time Machine,\\' I said, and took up\\nthe Psychologist\\'s account of our previous meeting. The new guests\\nwere frankly incredulous. The Editor raised objections. \\'What _was_\\nthis time travelling? A man couldn\\'t cover himself with dust by\\nrolling in a paradox, could he?\\' And then, as the idea came home to\\nhim, he resorted to caricature. Hadn\\'t they any clothes-brushes in\\nthe Future? The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, and\\njoined the Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole\\nthing. They were both the new kind of journalist--very joyous,\\nirreverent young men. \\'Our Special Correspondent in the Day\\nafter To-morrow reports,\\' the Journalist was saying--or rather\\nshouting--when the Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in\\nordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained\\nof the change that had startled me.\\n\\n\\'I say,\\' said the Editor hilariously, \\'these chaps here say you have\\nbeen travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about\\nlittle Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?\\'\\n\\nThe Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a\\nword. He smiled quietly, in his old way. \\'Where\\'s my mutton?\\' he\\nsaid. \\'What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!\\'\\n\\n\\'Story!\\' cried the Editor.\\n\\n\\'Story be damned!\\' said the Time Traveller. \\'I want something to\\neat. I won\\'t say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries.\\nThanks. And the salt.\\'\\n\\n\\'One word,\\' said I. \\'Have you been time travelling?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his\\nhead.\\n\\n\\'I\\'d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,\\' said the Editor.\\nThe Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang\\nit with his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been\\nstaring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine.\\nThe rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden\\nquestions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the same\\nwith the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by\\ntelling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Traveller devoted his\\nattention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp.\\nThe Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time Traveller\\nthrough his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than\\nusual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of\\nsheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate away,\\nand looked round us. \\'I suppose I must apologize,\\' he said. \\'I was\\nsimply starving. I\\'ve had a most amazing time.\\' He reached out his\\nhand for a cigar, and cut the end. \\'But come into the smoking-room.\\nIt\\'s too long a story to tell over greasy plates.\\' And ringing the\\nbell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining room.\\n\\n\\'You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?\\' he\\nsaid to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new\\nguests.\\n\\n\\'But the thing\\'s a mere paradox,\\' said the Editor.\\n\\n\\'I can\\'t argue to-night. I don\\'t mind telling you the story, but\\nI can\\'t argue. I will,\\' he went on, \\'tell you the story of what\\nhas happened to me, if you like, but you must refrain from\\ninterruptions. I want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like\\nlying. So be it! It\\'s true--every word of it, all the same. I was in\\nmy laboratory at four o\\'clock, and since then ... I\\'ve lived eight\\ndays ... such days as no human being ever lived before! I\\'m nearly\\nworn out, but I shan\\'t sleep till I\\'ve told this thing over to you.\\nThen I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it agreed?\\'\\n\\n\\'Agreed,\\' said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed \\'Agreed.\\' And\\nwith that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth.\\nHe sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man.\\nAfterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only\\ntoo much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink--and, above all, my\\nown inadequacy--to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,\\nattentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker\\'s white,\\nsincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the\\nintonation of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed\\nthe turns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the\\ncandles in the smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face\\nof the Journalist and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees\\ndownward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each\\nother. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the\\nTime Traveller\\'s face.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\n\\'I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time\\nMachine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the\\nworkshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of\\nthe ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of\\nit\\'s sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday, but on Friday,\\nwhen the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the\\nnickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get\\nremade; so that the thing was not complete until this morning. It\\nwas at ten o\\'clock to-day that the first of all Time Machines began\\nits career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put\\none more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the\\nsaddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels\\nmuch the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took\\nthe starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other,\\npressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to\\nreel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round,\\nI saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For\\na moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted\\nthe clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute\\nor so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three!\\n\\n\\'I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both\\nhands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went\\ndark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing\\nme, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to\\ntraverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room\\nlike a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The\\nnight came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment\\ncame to-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter\\nand ever fainter. To-morrow night came black, then day again, night\\nagain, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled\\nmy ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.\\n\\n\\'I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time\\ntravelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling\\nexactly like that one has upon a switchback--of a helpless headlong\\nmotion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent\\nsmash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a\\nblack wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to\\nfall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky,\\nleaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed\\nthe laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the open air.\\nI had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too\\nfast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that\\never crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of\\ndarkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the\\nintermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her\\nquarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling\\nstars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the\\npalpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness;\\nthe sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous\\ncolor like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak\\nof fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating\\nband; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a\\nbrighter circle flickering in the blue.\\n\\n\\'The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hill-side\\nupon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me\\ngrey and dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour,\\nnow brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away.\\nI saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams.\\nThe whole surface of the earth seemed changed--melting and flowing\\nunder my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that registered my\\nspeed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun\\nbelt swayed up and down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or\\nless, and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and\\nminute by minute the white snow flashed across the world, and\\nvanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring.\\n\\n\\'The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They\\nmerged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked\\nindeed a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to\\naccount. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a\\nkind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At\\nfirst I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but\\nthese new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions\\ngrew up in my mind--a certain curiosity and therewith a certain\\ndread--until at last they took complete possession of me. What\\nstrange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our\\nrudimentary civilization, I thought, might not appear when I came to\\nlook nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated\\nbefore my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising about\\nme, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it\\nseemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the\\nhill-side, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even\\nthrough the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. And so\\nmy mind came round to the business of stopping.\\n\\n\\'The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some\\nsubstance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long\\nas I travelled at a high velocity through time, this scarcely\\nmattered; I was, so to speak, attenuated--was slipping like a vapour\\nthrough the interstices of intervening substances! But to come to\\na stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into\\nwhatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimate\\ncontact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical\\nreaction--possibly a far-reaching explosion--would result, and blow\\nmyself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions--into the\\nUnknown. This possibility had occurred to me again and again while I\\nwas making the machine; but then I had cheerfully accepted it as an\\nunavoidable risk--one of the risks a man has got to take! Now the\\nrisk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light.\\nThe fact is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything,\\nthe sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the\\nfeeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerve. I told\\nmyself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I\\nresolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over\\nthe lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was\\nflung headlong through the air.\\n\\n\\'There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have\\nbeen stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me,\\nand I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine.\\nEverything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the\\nconfusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me. I was on what\\nseemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron\\nbushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were\\ndropping in a shower under the beating of the hail-stones. The\\nrebounding, dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine, and drove\\nalong the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin.\\n\"Fine hospitality,\" said I, \"to a man who has travelled innumerable\\nyears to see you.\"\\n\\n\\'Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and\\nlooked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white\\nstone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy\\ndownpour. But all else of the world was invisible.\\n\\n\\'My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail\\ngrew thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very\\nlarge, for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white\\nmarble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings,\\ninstead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so\\nthat it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of\\nbronze, and was thick with verdigris. It chanced that the face was\\ntowards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the\\nfaint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn,\\nand that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood\\nlooking at it for a little space--half a minute, perhaps, or half an\\nhour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it\\ndenser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment and\\nsaw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was\\nlightening with the promise of the sun.\\n\\n\\'I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full\\ntemerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when\\nthat hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have\\nhappened to men? What if cruelty had grown into a common passion?\\nWhat if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had\\ndeveloped into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly\\npowerful? I might seem some old-world savage animal, only the more\\ndreadful and disgusting for our common likeness--a foul creature to\\nbe incontinently slain.\\n\\n\\'Already I saw other vast shapes--huge buildings with intricate\\nparapets and tall columns, with a wooded hill-side dimly creeping\\nin upon me through the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic\\nfear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to\\nreadjust it. As I did so the shafts of the sun smote through the\\nthunderstorm. The grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like\\nthe trailing garments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blue\\nof the summer sky, some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into\\nnothingness. The great buildings about me stood out clear and\\ndistinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out\\nin white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I\\nfelt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in\\nthe clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop. My fear\\ngrew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and again\\ngrappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave under\\nmy desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. One\\nhand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily\\nin attitude to mount again.\\n\\n\\'But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I\\nlooked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote\\nfuture. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer\\nhouse, I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had\\nseen me, and their faces were directed towards me.\\n\\n\\'Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by\\nthe White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of\\nthese emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon\\nwhich I stood with my machine. He was a slight creature--perhaps\\nfour feet high--clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a\\nleather belt. Sandals or buskins--I could not clearly distinguish\\nwhich--were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his\\nhead was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warm\\nthe air was.\\n\\n\\'He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but\\nindescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more\\nbeautiful kind of consumptive--that hectic beauty of which we used\\nto hear so much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence.\\nI took my hands from the machine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\n\\n\\'In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile\\nthing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my\\neyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at\\nonce. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and\\nspoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.\\n\\n\\'There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps\\neight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them\\naddressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was\\ntoo harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my\\nears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then\\ntouched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my\\nback and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was\\nnothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in\\nthese pretty little people that inspired confidence--a graceful\\ngentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so\\nfrail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them\\nabout like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I\\nsaw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily\\nthen, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto\\nforgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the\\nlittle levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my\\npocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of\\ncommunication.\\n\\n\\'And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some\\nfurther peculiarities in their Dresden-china type of prettiness.\\nTheir hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the\\nneck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the\\nface, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small,\\nwith bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a\\npoint. The eyes were large and mild; and--this may seem egotism on\\nmy part--I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the\\ninterest I might have expected in them.\\n\\n\\'As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood\\nround me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I\\nbegan the conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself.\\nThen hesitating for a moment how to express time, I pointed to the\\nsun. At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and\\nwhite followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the\\nsound of thunder.\\n\\n\\'For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was\\nplain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were\\nthese creatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me.\\nYou see I had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight\\nHundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in\\nknowledge, art, everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a\\nquestion that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of\\nour five-year-old children--asked me, in fact, if I had come from\\nthe sun in a thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended\\nupon their clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features.\\nA flow of disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt\\nthat I had built the Time Machine in vain.\\n\\n\\'I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering\\nof a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so\\nand bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of\\nbeautiful flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck.\\nThe idea was received with melodious applause; and presently they\\nwere all running to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging\\nthem upon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. You who\\nhave never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and\\nwonderful flowers countless years of culture had created. Then\\nsomeone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the\\nnearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble,\\nwhich had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my\\nastonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. As I\\nwent with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a\\nprofoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible\\nmerriment, to my mind.\\n\\n\\'The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal\\ndimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of\\nlittle people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me\\nshadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw\\nover their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and\\nflowers, a long neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number\\nof tall spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps\\nacross the spread of the waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if\\nwild, among the variegated shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine\\nthem closely at this time. The Time Machine was left deserted on the\\nturf among the rhododendrons.\\n\\n\\'The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did\\nnot observe the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw\\nsuggestions of old Phoenician decorations as I passed through, and\\nit struck me that they were very badly broken and weather-worn.\\nSeveral more brightly clad people met me in the doorway, and so we\\nentered, I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments, looking\\ngrotesque enough, garlanded with flowers, and surrounded by an\\neddying mass of bright, soft-colored robes and shining white limbs,\\nin a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech.\\n\\n\\'The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with\\nbrown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed\\nwith coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered\\nlight. The floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white\\nmetal, not plates nor slabs--blocks, and it was so much worn, as I\\njudged by the going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply\\nchannelled along the more frequented ways. Transverse to the length\\nwere innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised\\nperhaps a foot from the floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits.\\nSome I recognized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange,\\nbut for the most part they were strange.\\n\\n\\'Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions.\\nUpon these my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do\\nlikewise. With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the\\nfruit with their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into\\nthe round openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to\\nfollow their example, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I\\nsurveyed the hall at my leisure.\\n\\n\\'And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look.\\nThe stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical\\npattern, were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung\\nacross the lower end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that\\nthe corner of the marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless,\\nthe general effect was extremely rich and picturesque. There were,\\nperhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall, and most of\\nthem, seated as near to me as they could come, were watching me with\\ninterest, their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating.\\nAll were clad in the same soft and yet strong, silky material.\\n\\n\\'Fruit, by the by, was all their diet. These people of the remote\\nfuture were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite\\nof some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I\\nfound afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the\\nIchthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful;\\none, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was\\nthere--a floury thing in a three-sided husk--was especially good,\\nand I made it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange\\nfruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to\\nperceive their import.\\n\\n\\'However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future\\nnow. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to\\nmake a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of\\nmine. Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a\\nconvenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began\\na series of interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some\\nconsiderable difficulty in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts\\nmet with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter, but\\npresently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention\\nand repeated a name. They had to chatter and explain the business\\nat great length to each other, and my first attempts to make the\\nexquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount\\nof amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children,\\nand persisted, and presently I had a score of noun substantives at\\nleast at my command; and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and\\neven the verb \"to eat.\" But it was slow work, and the little people\\nsoon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations, so I\\ndetermined, rather of necessity, to let them give their lessons in\\nlittle doses when they felt inclined. And very little doses I found\\nthey were before long, for I never met people more indolent or more\\neasily fatigued.\\n\\n\\'A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was\\ntheir lack of interest. They would come to me with eager cries of\\nastonishment, like children, but like children they would soon stop\\nexamining me and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my\\nconversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that\\nalmost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is\\nodd, too, how speedily I came to disregard these little people. I\\nwent out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as\\nmy hunger was satisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men\\nof the future, who would follow me a little distance, chatter and\\nlaugh about me, and, having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly\\nway, leave me again to my own devices.\\n\\n\\'The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great\\nhall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun.\\nAt first things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely\\ndifferent from the world I had known--even the flowers. The big\\nbuilding I had left was situated on the slope of a broad river\\nvalley, but the Thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present\\nposition. I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a\\nmile and a half away, from which I could get a wider view of this\\nour planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred\\nand One A.D. For that, I should explain, was the date the little\\ndials of my machine recorded.\\n\\n\\'As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly\\nhelp to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I\\nfound the world--for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for\\ninstance, was a great heap of granite, bound together by masses of\\naluminium, a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled\\nheaps, amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like\\nplants--nettles possibly--but wonderfully tinted with brown about\\nthe leaves, and incapable of stinging. It was evidently the derelict\\nremains of some vast structure, to what end built I could not\\ndetermine. It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to have\\na very strange experience--the first intimation of a still stranger\\ndiscovery--but of that I will speak in its proper place.\\n\\n\\'Looking round with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I\\nrested for a while, I realized that there were no small houses to be\\nseen. Apparently the single house, and possibly even the household,\\nhad vanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like\\nbuildings, but the house and the cottage, which form such\\ncharacteristic features of our own English landscape, had\\ndisappeared.\\n\\n\\'\"Communism,\" said I to myself.\\n\\n\\'And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the\\nhalf-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash,\\nI perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft\\nhairless visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem\\nstrange, perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything\\nwas so strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and\\nin all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the\\nsexes from each other, these people of the future were alike. And\\nthe children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their\\nparents. I judged, then, that the children of that time were\\nextremely precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards\\nabundant verification of my opinion.\\n\\n\\'Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I\\nfelt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what\\none would expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a\\nwoman, the institution of the family, and the differentiation of\\noccupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical\\nforce; where population is balanced and abundant, much childbearing\\nbecomes an evil rather than a blessing to the State; where\\nviolence comes but rarely and off-spring are secure, there is less\\nnecessity--indeed there is no necessity--for an efficient family,\\nand the specialization of the sexes with reference to their\\nchildren\\'s needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even\\nin our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I\\nmust remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to\\nappreciate how far it fell short of the reality.\\n\\n\\'While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by\\na pretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in\\na transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then\\nresumed the thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings\\ntowards the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently\\nmiraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a\\nstrange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.\\n\\n\\'There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognize,\\ncorroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered\\nin soft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of\\ngriffins\\' heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of\\nour old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and\\nfair a view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the\\nhorizon and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal\\nbars of purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in\\nwhich the river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already\\nspoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated\\ngreenery, some in ruins and some still occupied. Here and there rose\\na white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth, here and\\nthere came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There\\nwere no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of\\nagriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.\\n\\n\\'So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had\\nseen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation\\nwas something in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a\\nhalf-truth--or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)\\n\\n\\'It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane.\\nThe ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the\\nfirst time I began to realize an odd consequence of the social\\neffort in which we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think,\\nit is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need;\\nsecurity sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the\\nconditions of life--the true civilizing process that makes life more\\nand more secure--had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a\\nunited humanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are\\nnow mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and\\ncarried forward. And the harvest was what I saw!\\n\\n\\'After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of to-day are still\\nin the rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but\\na little department of the field of human disease, but even so,\\nit spreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our\\nagriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and\\ncultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the\\ngreater number to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our\\nfavourite plants and animals--and how few they are--gradually by\\nselective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a seedless\\ngrape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breed\\nof cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideals are vague\\nand tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature,\\ntoo, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all this will\\nbe better organized, and still better. That is the drift of the\\ncurrent in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent,\\neducated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster\\ntowards the subjugation of Nature. In the end, wisely and carefully\\nwe shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit\\nour human needs.\\n\\n\\'This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done\\nindeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine\\nhad leaped. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or\\nfungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers;\\nbrilliant butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of\\npreventive medicine was attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I\\nsaw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay. And I\\nshall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefaction\\nand decay had been profoundly affected by these changes.\\n\\n\\'Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in\\nsplendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them\\nengaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social\\nnor economical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all\\nthat commerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It\\nwas natural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of\\na social paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been\\nmet, I guessed, and population had ceased to increase.\\n\\n\\'But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to\\nthe change. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is\\nthe cause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom:\\nconditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and\\nthe weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the\\nloyal alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and\\ndecision. And the institution of the family, and the emotions that\\narise therein, the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring,\\nparental self-devotion, all found their justification and support in\\nthe imminent dangers of the young. _Now_, where are these imminent\\ndangers? There is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against\\nconnubial jealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion\\nof all sorts; unnecessary things now, and things that make us\\nuncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant\\nlife.\\n\\n\\'I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of\\nintelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my\\nbelief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes\\nQuiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had\\nused all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which\\nit lived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.\\n\\n\\'Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that\\nrestless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness.\\nEven in our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary\\nto survival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and\\nthe love of battle, for instance, are no great help--may even be\\nhindrances--to a civilized man. And in a state of physical balance\\nand security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out\\nof place. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of\\nwar or solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting\\ndisease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil. For\\nsuch a life, what we should call the weak are as well equipped as\\nthe strong, are indeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they\\nare, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there\\nwas no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw\\nwas the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy\\nof mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the\\nconditions under which it lived--the flourish of that triumph which\\nbegan the last great peace. This has ever been the fate of energy in\\nsecurity; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor\\nand decay.\\n\\n\\'Even this artistic impetus would at last die away--had almost died\\nin the Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to\\nsing in the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and\\nno more. Even that would fade in the end into a contented\\ninactivity. We are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and\\nnecessity, and, it seemed to me, that here was that hateful\\ngrindstone broken at last!\\n\\n\\'As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this\\nsimple explanation I had mastered the problem of the world--mastered\\nthe whole secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they\\nhad devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well,\\nand their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary.\\nThat would account for the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my\\nexplanation, and plausible enough--as most wrong theories are!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\n\\'As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the\\nfull moon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver\\nlight in the north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move\\nabout below, a noiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the\\nchill of the night. I determined to descend and find where I could\\nsleep.\\n\\n\\'I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to\\nthe figure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing\\ndistinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see\\nthe silver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron\\nbushes, black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn.\\nI looked at the lawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency.\\n\"No,\" said I stoutly to myself, \"that was not the lawn.\"\\n\\n\\'But it _was_ the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was\\ntowards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came\\nhome to me? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!\\n\\n\\'At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of\\nlosing my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world.\\nThe bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could\\nfeel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing. In another\\nmoment I was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping\\nstrides down the slope. Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost\\nno time in stanching the blood, but jumped up and ran on, with a\\nwarm trickle down my cheek and chin. All the time I ran I was saying\\nto myself: \"They have moved it a little, pushed it under the bushes\\nout of the way.\" Nevertheless, I ran with all my might. All the\\ntime, with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread,\\nI knew that such assurance was folly, knew instinctively that the\\nmachine was removed out of my reach. My breath came with pain. I\\nsuppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the\\nlittle lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young\\nman. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in leaving the\\nmachine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and none\\nanswered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit\\nworld.\\n\\n\\'When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realized. Not a trace\\nof the thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the\\nempty space among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it\\nfuriously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner, and then\\nstopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair. Above me towered\\nthe sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in\\nthe light of the rising moon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my\\ndismay.\\n\\n\\'I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put\\nthe mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of\\ntheir physical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed\\nme: the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose\\nintervention my invention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt\\nassured: unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate,\\nthe machine could not have moved in time. The attachment of the\\nlevers--I will show you the method later--prevented any one from\\ntampering with it in that way when they were removed. It had moved,\\nand was hid, only in space. But then, where could it be?\\n\\n\\'I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running\\nviolently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx,\\nand startling some white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a\\nsmall deer. I remember, too, late that night, beating the bushes\\nwith my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding\\nfrom the broken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of\\nmind, I went down to the great building of stone. The big hall was\\ndark, silent, and deserted. I slipped on the uneven floor, and fell\\nover one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. I lit a\\nmatch and went on past the dusty curtains, of which I have told you.\\n\\n\\'There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon\\nwhich, perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I\\nhave no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming\\nsuddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the\\nsplutter and flare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches.\\n\"Where is my Time Machine?\" I began, bawling like an angry child,\\nlaying hands upon them and shaking them up together. It must have\\nbeen very queer to them. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely\\nfrightened. When I saw them standing round me, it came into my head\\nthat I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do\\nunder the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear.\\nFor, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear\\nmust be forgotten.\\n\\n\\'Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and, knocking one of the people\\nover in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again,\\nout under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little\\nfeet running and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all\\nI did as the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected\\nnature of my loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from\\nmy own kind--a strange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved\\nto and fro, screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory\\nof horrible fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of\\nlooking in this impossible place and that; of groping among moon-lit\\nruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last,\\nof lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute\\nwretchedness. I had nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when\\nI woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping\\nround me on the turf within reach of my arm.\\n\\n\\'I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how\\nI had got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion\\nand despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain,\\nreasonable daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the\\nface. I saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could\\nreason with myself. \"Suppose the worst?\" I said. \"Suppose the\\nmachine altogether lost--perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be\\ncalm and patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear\\nidea of the method of my loss, and the means of getting materials\\nand tools; so that in the end, perhaps, I may make another.\" That\\nwould be my only hope, perhaps, but better than despair. And, after\\nall, it was a beautiful and curious world.\\n\\n\\'But probably, the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must\\nbe calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force\\nor cunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about\\nme, wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and\\ntravel-soiled. The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal\\nfreshness. I had exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about\\nmy business, I found myself wondering at my intense excitement\\novernight. I made a careful examination of the ground about the\\nlittle lawn. I wasted some time in futile questionings, conveyed, as\\nwell as I was able, to such of the little people as came by. They\\nall failed to understand my gestures; some were simply stolid, some\\nthought it was a jest and laughed at me. I had the hardest task in\\nthe world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces. It was\\na foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger\\nwas ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity.\\nThe turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about\\nmidway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet\\nwhere, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine.\\nThere were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow\\nfootprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed\\nmy closer attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said,\\nof bronze. It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep\\nframed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. The\\npedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with care I found them\\ndiscontinuous with the frames. There were no handles or keyholes,\\nbut possibly the panels, if they were doors, as I supposed, opened\\nfrom within. One thing was clear enough to my mind. It took no very\\ngreat mental effort to infer that my Time Machine was inside that\\npedestal. But how it got there was a different problem.\\n\\n\\'I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes\\nand under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned\\nsmiling to them and beckoned them to me. They came, and then,\\npointing to the bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open\\nit. But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I\\ndon\\'t know how to convey their expression to you. Suppose you were\\nto use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman--it is\\nhow she would look. They went off as if they had received the last\\npossible insult. I tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next,\\nwith exactly the same result. Somehow, his manner made me feel\\nashamed of myself. But, as you know, I wanted the Time Machine, and\\nI tried him once more. As he turned off, like the others, my temper\\ngot the better of me. In three strides I was after him, had him by\\nthe loose part of his robe round the neck, and began dragging him\\ntowards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of his\\nface, and all of a sudden I let him go.\\n\\n\\'But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze\\npanels. I thought I heard something stir inside--to be explicit,\\nI thought I heard a sound like a chuckle--but I must have been\\nmistaken. Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came and\\nhammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and the\\nverdigris came off in powdery flakes. The delicate little people\\nmust have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on\\neither hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd of them upon the\\nslopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I sat down\\nto watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too\\nOccidental for a long vigil. I could work at a problem for years,\\nbut to wait inactive for twenty-four hours--that is another matter.\\n\\n\\'I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the\\nbushes towards the hill again. \"Patience,\" said I to myself. \"If you\\nwant your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they\\nmean to take your machine away, it\\'s little good your wrecking their\\nbronze panels, and if they don\\'t, you will get it back as soon as\\nyou can ask for it. To sit among all those unknown things before a\\npuzzle like that is hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this\\nworld. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses\\nat its meaning. In the end you will find clues to it all.\" Then\\nsuddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind: the thought\\nof the years I had spent in study and toil to get into the future\\nage, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it. I had made\\nmyself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a\\nman devised. Although it was at my own expense, I could not help\\nmyself. I laughed aloud.\\n\\n\\'Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little\\npeople avoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had\\nsomething to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt\\ntolerably sure of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no\\nconcern and to abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course\\nof a day or two things got back to the old footing. I made what\\nprogress I could in the language, and in addition I pushed my\\nexplorations here and there. Either I missed some subtle point or\\ntheir language was excessively simple--almost exclusively composed\\nof concrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be few, if any,\\nabstract terms, or little use of figurative language. Their\\nsentences were usually simple and of two words, and I failed to\\nconvey or understand any but the simplest propositions. I determined\\nto put the thought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronze\\ndoors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory,\\nuntil my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural\\nway. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in a\\ncircle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.\\n\\n\\'So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant\\nrichness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the\\nsame abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material\\nand style, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same\\nblossom-laden trees and tree-ferns. Here and there water shone like\\nsilver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and\\nso faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which\\npresently attracted my attention, was the presence of certain\\ncircular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth.\\nOne lay by the path up the hill, which I had followed during my\\nfirst walk. Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze, curiously\\nwrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain. Sitting by\\nthe side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness,\\nI could see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection\\nwith a lighted match. But in all of them I heard a certain sound:\\na thud--thud--thud, like the beating of some big engine; and I\\ndiscovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady current of\\nair set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper into the\\nthroat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was at\\nonce sucked swiftly out of sight.\\n\\n\\'After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers\\nstanding here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was\\noften just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above\\na sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong\\nsuggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose\\ntrue import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to\\nassociate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an\\nobvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong.\\n\\n\\'And here I must admit that I learned very little of drains and\\nbells and modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my\\ntime in this real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and\\ncoming times which I have read, there is a vast amount of detail\\nabout building, and social arrangements, and so forth. But while\\nsuch details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is\\ncontained in one\\'s imagination, they are altogether inaccessible to\\na real traveller amid such realities as I found here. Conceive the\\ntale of London which a negro, fresh from Central Africa, would take\\nback to his tribe! What would he know of railway companies, of\\nsocial movements, of telephone and telegraph wires, of the Parcels\\nDelivery Company, and postal orders and the like? Yet we, at least,\\nshould be willing enough to explain these things to him! And even of\\nwhat he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either\\napprehend or believe? Then, think how narrow the gap between a negro\\nand a white man of our own times, and how wide the interval between\\nmyself and these of the Golden Age! I was sensible of much which was\\nunseen, and which contributed to my comfort; but save for a general\\nimpression of automatic organization, I fear I can convey very\\nlittle of the difference to your mind.\\n\\n\\'In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of\\ncrematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me\\nthat, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere\\nbeyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I\\ndeliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely\\ndefeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make\\na further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm\\namong this people there were none.\\n\\n\\'I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an\\nautomatic civilization and a decadent humanity did not long endure.\\nYet I could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The\\nseveral big palaces I had explored were mere living places, great\\ndining-halls and sleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no\\nappliances of any kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant\\nfabrics that must at times need renewal, and their sandals, though\\nundecorated, were fairly complex specimens of metalwork. Somehow\\nsuch things must be made. And the little people displayed no vestige\\nof a creative tendency. There were no shops, no workshops, no sign\\nof importations among them. They spent all their time in playing\\ngently, in bathing in the river, in making love in a half-playful\\nfashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see how things\\nwere kept going.\\n\\n\\'Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what,\\nhad taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? For\\nthe life of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too,\\nthose flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt--how shall\\nI put it? Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and\\nthere in excellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others\\nmade up of words, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well,\\non the third day of my visit, that was how the world of Eight\\nHundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to\\nme!\\n\\n\\'That day, too, I made a friend--of a sort. It happened that, as I\\nwas watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of\\nthem was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main\\ncurrent ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate\\nswimmer. It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange\\ndeficiency in these creatures, when I tell you that none made the\\nslightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which\\nwas drowning before their eyes. When I realized this, I hurriedly\\nslipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, I\\ncaught the poor mite and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing of\\nthe limbs soon brought her round, and I had the satisfaction of\\nseeing she was all right before I left her. I had got to such a low\\nestimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her.\\nIn that, however, I was wrong.\\n\\n\\'This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little\\nwoman, as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre\\nfrom an exploration, and she received me with cries of delight and\\npresented me with a big garland of flowers--evidently made for me\\nand me alone. The thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had\\nbeen feeling desolate. At any rate I did my best to display my\\nappreciation of the gift. We were soon seated together in a little\\nstone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles. The\\ncreature\\'s friendliness affected me exactly as a child\\'s might have\\ndone. We passed each other flowers, and she kissed my hands. I did\\nthe same to hers. Then I tried talk, and found that her name was\\nWeena, which, though I don\\'t know what it meant, somehow seemed\\nappropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendship\\nwhich lasted a week, and ended--as I will tell you!\\n\\n\\'She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She\\ntried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about\\nit went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last,\\nexhausted and calling after me rather plaintively. But the problems\\nof the world had to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come\\ninto the future to carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress\\nwhen I left her was very great, her expostulations at the parting\\nwere sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as much\\ntrouble as comfort from her devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow,\\na very great comfort. I thought it was mere childish affection that\\nmade her cling to me. Until it was too late, I did not clearly know\\nwhat I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Nor until it was too\\nlate did I clearly understand what she was to me. For, by merely\\nseeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that she\\ncared for me, the little doll of a creature presently gave my return\\nto the neighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling of\\ncoming home; and I would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold\\nso soon as I came over the hill.\\n\\n\\'It was from her, too, that I learned that fear had not yet left the\\nworld. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the\\noddest confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made\\nthreatening grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she\\ndreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness\\nto her was the one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate\\nemotion, and it set me thinking and observing. I discovered then,\\namong other things, that these little people gathered into the great\\nhouses after dark, and slept in droves. To enter upon them without a\\nlight was to put them into a tumult of apprehension. I never found\\none out of doors, or one sleeping alone within doors, after dark.\\nYet I was still such a blockhead that I missed the lesson of that\\nfear, and in spite of Weena\\'s distress I insisted upon sleeping away\\nfrom these slumbering multitudes.\\n\\n\\'It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me\\ntriumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including\\nthe last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm.\\nBut my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been\\nthe night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had\\nbeen restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and\\nthat sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps.\\nI woke with a start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal\\nhad just rushed out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again,\\nbut I felt restless and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour\\nwhen things are just creeping out of darkness, when everything is\\ncolourless and clear cut, and yet unreal. I got up, and went down\\ninto the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in front of the\\npalace. I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the\\nsunrise.\\n\\n\\'The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor\\nof dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky\\nblack, the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless.\\nAnd up the hill I thought I could see ghosts. There several times,\\nas I scanned the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw\\na solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up the\\nhill, and once near the ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some\\ndark body. They moved hastily. I did not see what became of them.\\nIt seemed that they vanished among the bushes. The dawn was still\\nindistinct, you must understand. I was feeling that chill,\\nuncertain, early-morning feeling you may have known. I doubted\\nmy eyes.\\n\\n\\'As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on\\nand its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned\\nthe view keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were\\nmere creatures of the half light. \"They must have been ghosts,\" I\\nsaid; \"I wonder whence they dated.\" For a queer notion of Grant\\nAllen\\'s came into my head, and amused me. If each generation die and\\nleave ghosts, he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with\\nthem. On that theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight\\nHundred Thousand Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four\\nat once. But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these\\nfigures all the morning, until Weena\\'s rescue drove them out of my\\nhead. I associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal\\nI had startled in my first passionate search for the Time Machine.\\nBut Weena was a pleasant substitute. Yet all the same, they were\\nsoon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind.\\n\\n\\'I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather\\nof this Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun\\nwas hotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that\\nthe sun will go on cooling steadily in the future. But people,\\nunfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger Darwin,\\nforget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into\\nthe parent body. As these catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze\\nwith renewed energy; and it may be that some inner planet had\\nsuffered this fate. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the\\nsun was very much hotter than we know it.\\n\\n\\'Well, one very hot morning--my fourth, I think--as I was seeking\\nshelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great\\nhouse where I slept and fed, there happened this strange thing:\\nClambering among these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery,\\nwhose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone.\\nBy contrast with the brilliancy outside, it seemed at first\\nimpenetrably dark to me. I entered it groping, for the change from\\nlight to blackness made spots of colour swim before me. Suddenly I\\nhalted spellbound. A pair of eyes, luminous by reflection against\\nthe daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness.\\n\\n\\'The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched\\nmy hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was\\nafraid to turn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which\\nhumanity appeared to be living came to my mind. And then I\\nremembered that strange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to\\nsome extent, I advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my\\nvoice was harsh and ill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched\\nsomething soft. At once the eyes darted sideways, and something\\nwhite ran past me. I turned with my heart in my mouth, and saw a\\nqueer little ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiar\\nmanner, running across the sunlit space behind me. It blundered\\nagainst a block of granite, staggered aside, and in a moment was\\nhidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry.\\n\\n\\'My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a\\ndull white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there\\nwas flaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it\\nwent too fast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it\\nran on all-fours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an\\ninstant\\'s pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could\\nnot find it at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I\\ncame upon one of those round well-like openings of which I have told\\nyou, half closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me.\\nCould this Thing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and,\\nlooking down, I saw a small, white, moving creature, with large\\nbright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated. It made\\nme shudder. It was so like a human spider! It was clambering down\\nthe wall, and now I saw for the first time a number of metal foot\\nand hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft. Then the\\nlight burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it\\ndropped, and when I had lit another the little monster had\\ndisappeared.\\n\\n\\'I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for\\nsome time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I\\nhad seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that\\nMan had not remained one species, but had differentiated into two\\ndistinct animals: that my graceful children of the Upper-world were\\nnot the sole descendants of our generation, but that this bleached,\\nobscene, nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir\\nto all the ages.\\n\\n\\'I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an\\nunderground ventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And\\nwhat, I wondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly\\nbalanced organization? How was it related to the indolent serenity\\nof the beautiful Upper-worlders? And what was hidden down there,\\nat the foot of that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling\\nmyself that, at any rate, there was nothing to fear, and that there\\nI must descend for the solution of my difficulties. And withal I\\nwas absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two of the beautiful\\nUpper-world people came running in their amorous sport across the\\ndaylight in the shadow. The male pursued the female, flinging\\nflowers at her as he ran.\\n\\n\\'They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned\\npillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form\\nto remark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried\\nto frame a question about it in their tongue, they were still more\\nvisibly distressed and turned away. But they were interested by my\\nmatches, and I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about\\nthe well, and again I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to\\ngo back to Weena, and see what I could get from her. But my mind was\\nalready in revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and\\nsliding to a new adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these\\nwells, to the ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to\\nsay nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the\\nfate of the Time Machine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion\\ntowards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me.\\n\\n\\'Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was\\nsubterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which\\nmade me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome\\nof a long-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was\\nthe bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the\\ndark--the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then,\\nthose large eyes, with that capacity for reflecting light, are\\ncommon features of nocturnal things--witness the owl and the cat.\\nAnd last of all, that evident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty\\nyet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar\\ncarriage of the head while in the light--all reinforced the theory\\nof an extreme sensitiveness of the retina.\\n\\n\\'Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and\\nthese tunnellings were the habitat of the new race. The presence of\\nventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes--everywhere, in\\nfact, except along the river valley--showed how universal were its\\nramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in\\nthis artificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the\\ncomfort of the daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible\\nthat I at once accepted it, and went on to assume the _how_ of this\\nsplitting of the human species. I dare say you will anticipate the\\nshape of my theory; though, for myself, I very soon felt that it\\nfell far short of the truth.\\n\\n\\'At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed\\nclear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present\\nmerely temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and\\nthe Labourer, was the key to the whole position. No doubt it will\\nseem grotesque enough to you--and wildly incredible!--and yet even\\nnow there are existing circumstances to point that way. There is\\na tendency to utilize underground space for the less ornamental\\npurposes of civilization; there is the Metropolitan Railway in\\nLondon, for instance, there are new electric railways, there are\\nsubways, there are underground workrooms and restaurants, and they\\nincrease and multiply. Evidently, I thought, this tendency had\\nincreased till Industry had gradually lost its birthright in the\\nsky. I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever\\nlarger underground factories, spending a still-increasing amount of\\nits time therein, till, in the end--! Even now, does not an East-end\\nworker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut\\noff from the natural surface of the earth?\\n\\n\\'Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people--due, no doubt, to\\nthe increasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf\\nbetween them and the rude violence of the poor--is already leading\\nto the closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the\\nsurface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the\\nprettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this same\\nwidening gulf--which is due to the length and expense of the higher\\neducational process and the increased facilities for and temptations\\ntowards refined habits on the part of the rich--will make that\\nexchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage\\nwhich at present retards the splitting of our species along lines\\nof social stratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end,\\nabove ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfort\\nand beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers getting\\ncontinually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once they\\nwere there, they would no doubt have to pay rent, and not a little\\nof it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused,\\nthey would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of them as were\\nso constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in\\nthe end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as\\nwell adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as happy in\\ntheir way, as the Upper-world people were to theirs. As it seemed to\\nme, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally\\nenough.\\n\\n\\'The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different\\nshape in my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and\\ngeneral co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real\\naristocracy, armed with a perfected science and working to a logical\\nconclusion the industrial system of to-day. Its triumph had not been\\nsimply a triumph over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the\\nfellow-man. This, I must warn you, was my theory at the time. I had\\nno convenient cicerone in the pattern of the Utopian books. My\\nexplanation may be absolutely wrong. I still think it is the\\nmost plausible one. But even on this supposition the balanced\\ncivilization that was at last attained must have long since passed\\nits zenith, and was now far fallen into decay. The too-perfect\\nsecurity of the Upper-worlders had led them to a slow movement of\\ndegeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and\\nintelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had\\nhappened to the Under-grounders I did not yet suspect; but from what\\nI had seen of the Morlocks--that, by the by, was the name by which\\nthese creatures were called--I could imagine that the modification\\nof the human type was even far more profound than among the \"Eloi,\"\\nthe beautiful race that I already knew.\\n\\n\\'Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time\\nMachine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if\\nthe Eloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And\\nwhy were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have\\nsaid, to question Weena about this Under-world, but here again I was\\ndisappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and\\npresently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the\\ntopic was unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little\\nharshly, she burst into tears. They were the only tears, except my\\nown, I ever saw in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased\\nabruptly to trouble about the Morlocks, and was only concerned in\\nbanishing these signs of the human inheritance from Weena\\'s eyes.\\nAnd very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands, while I\\nsolemnly burned a match.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\n\\n\\'It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow\\nup the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt\\na peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the\\nhalf-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in\\nspirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the\\ntouch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic\\ninfluence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began\\nto appreciate.\\n\\n\\'The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a\\nlittle disordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once\\nor twice I had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive\\nno definite reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great\\nhall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight--that\\nnight Weena was among them--and feeling reassured by their presence.\\nIt occurred to me even then, that in the course of a few days the\\nmoon must pass through its last quarter, and the nights grow dark,\\nwhen the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below, these\\nwhitened Lemurs, this new vermin that had replaced the old, might be\\nmore abundant. And on both these days I had the restless feeling of\\none who shirks an inevitable duty. I felt assured that the Time\\nMachine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these\\nunderground mysteries. Yet I could not face the mystery. If only I\\nhad had a companion it would have been different. But I was so\\nhorribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness of the\\nwell appalled me. I don\\'t know if you will understand my feeling,\\nbut I never felt quite safe at my back.\\n\\n\\'It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me\\nfurther and further afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the\\nsouth-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe\\nWood, I observed far off, in the direction of nineteenth-century\\nBanstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any\\nI had hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces\\nor ruins I knew, and the facade had an Oriental look: the face\\nof it having the lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind\\nof bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. This\\ndifference in aspect suggested a difference in use, and I was minded\\nto push on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had come\\nupon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so I\\nresolved to hold over the adventure for the following day, and I\\nreturned to the welcome and the caresses of little Weena. But next\\nmorning I perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the\\nPalace of Green Porcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enable\\nme to shirk, by another day, an experience I dreaded. I resolved I\\nwould make the descent without further waste of time, and started\\nout in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite\\nand aluminium.\\n\\n\\'Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but\\nwhen she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed\\nstrangely disconcerted. \"Good-bye, little Weena,\" I said, kissing\\nher; and then putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet\\nfor the climbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for\\nI feared my courage might leak away! At first she watched me in\\namazement. Then she gave a most piteous cry, and running to me, she\\nbegan to pull at me with her little hands. I think her opposition\\nnerved me rather to proceed. I shook her off, perhaps a little\\nroughly, and in another moment I was in the throat of the well. I\\nsaw her agonized face over the parapet, and smiled to reassure her.\\nThen I had to look down at the unstable hooks to which I clung.\\n\\n\\'I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The\\ndescent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from\\nthe sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of\\na creature much smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily\\ncramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of\\nthe bars bent suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into\\nthe blackness beneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after\\nthat experience I did not dare to rest again. Though my arms and\\nback were presently acutely painful, I went on clambering down the\\nsheer descent with as quick a motion as possible. Glancing upward,\\nI saw the aperture, a small blue disk, in which a star was visible,\\nwhile little Weena\\'s head showed as a round black projection. The\\nthudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive.\\nEverything save that little disk above was profoundly dark, and when\\nI looked up again Weena had disappeared.\\n\\n\\'I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go\\nup the shaft again, and leave the Under-world alone. But even while\\nI turned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with\\nintense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a\\nslender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the\\naperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and\\nrest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I\\nwas trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the\\nunbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air\\nwas full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the\\nshaft.\\n\\n\\'I do not know how long I lay. I was roused by a soft hand touching\\nmy face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and,\\nhastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar\\nto the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating\\nbefore the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me\\nimpenetrable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and\\nsensitive, just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they\\nreflected the light in the same way. I have no doubt they could see\\nme in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any fear\\nof me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match in\\norder to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark\\ngutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the\\nstrangest fashion.\\n\\n\\'I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently\\ndifferent from that of the Over-world people; so that I was needs\\nleft to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before\\nexploration was even then in my mind. But I said to myself, \"You are\\nin for it now,\" and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the\\nnoise of machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from\\nme, and I came to a large open space, and striking another match,\\nsaw that I had entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into\\nutter darkness beyond the range of my light. The view I had of it\\nwas as much as one could see in the burning of a match.\\n\\n\\'Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose\\nout of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim\\nspectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the by,\\nwas very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly\\nshed blood was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a\\nlittle table of white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The\\nMorlocks at any rate were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember\\nwondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red\\njoint I saw. It was all very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big\\nunmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the shadows, and\\nonly waiting for the darkness to come at me again! Then the match\\nburned down, and stung my fingers, and fell, a wriggling red spot\\nin the blackness.\\n\\n\\'I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such\\nan experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had\\nstarted with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would\\ncertainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances.\\nI had come without arms, without medicine, without anything to\\nsmoke--at times I missed tobacco frightfully--even without enough\\nmatches. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that\\nglimpse of the Underworld in a second, and examined it at leisure.\\nBut, as it was, I stood there with only the weapons and the powers\\nthat Nature had endowed me with--hands, feet, and teeth; these, and\\nfour safety-matches that still remained to me.\\n\\n\\'I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the\\ndark, and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered\\nthat my store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me\\nuntil that moment that there was any need to economize them, and I\\nhad wasted almost half the box in astonishing the Upper-worlders, to\\nwhom fire was a novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I\\nstood in the dark, a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling\\nover my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I\\nfancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little\\nbeings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently\\ndisengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The\\nsense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably\\nunpleasant. The sudden realization of my ignorance of their ways of\\nthinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I\\nshouted at them as loudly as I could. They started away, and then\\nI could feel them approaching me again. They clutched at me more\\nboldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I shivered violently,\\nand shouted again--rather discordantly. This time they were not so\\nseriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as they came\\nback at me. I will confess I was horribly frightened. I determined\\nto strike another match and escape under the protection of its\\nglare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper\\nfrom my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But I\\nhad scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the\\nblackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves,\\nand pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me.\\n\\n\\'In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no\\nmistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another\\nlight, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine\\nhow nauseatingly inhuman they looked--those pale, chinless faces\\nand great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!--as they stared in their\\nblindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise\\nyou: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck\\nmy third. It had almost burned through when I reached the opening\\ninto the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for the throb of the great\\npump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projecting\\nhooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and I\\nwas violently tugged backward. I lit my last match ... and it\\nincontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now,\\nand, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the\\nMorlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed\\npeering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who\\nfollowed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy.\\n\\n\\'That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or\\nthirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest\\ndifficulty in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful\\nstruggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I\\nfelt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the\\nwell-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding\\nsunlight. I fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean.\\nThen I remember Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of\\nothers among the Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\n\\n\\'Now, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto,\\nexcept during my night\\'s anguish at the loss of the Time Machine,\\nI had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was\\nstaggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought\\nmyself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people, and\\nby some unknown forces which I had only to understand to overcome;\\nbut there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of\\nthe Morlocks--a something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I\\nloathed them. Before, I had felt as a man might feel who had fallen\\ninto a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it.\\nNow I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy would come upon him\\nsoon.\\n\\n\\'The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the\\nnew moon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first\\nincomprehensible remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now\\nsuch a very difficult problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights\\nmight mean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was a longer\\ninterval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree at\\nleast the reason of the fear of the little Upper-world people for\\nthe dark. I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that\\nthe Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure now that\\nmy second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upper-world people might\\nonce have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their\\nmechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two\\nspecies that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding\\ndown towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new\\nrelationship. The Eloi, like the Carolingian kings, had decayed\\nto a mere beautiful futility. They still possessed the earth on\\nsufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable\\ngenerations, had come at last to find the daylit surface\\nintolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and\\nmaintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the\\nsurvival of an old habit of service. They did it as a standing horse\\npaws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport:\\nbecause ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the\\norganism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed.\\nThe Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago,\\nthousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of\\nthe ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back\\nchanged! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew.\\nThey were becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came\\ninto my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the Under-world.\\nIt seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it\\nwere by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a\\nquestion from outside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had a\\nvague sense of something familiar, but I could not tell what it was\\nat the time.\\n\\n\\'Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their\\nmysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this\\nage of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not\\nparalyse and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend\\nmyself. Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and a\\nfastness where I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could\\nface this strange world with some of that confidence I had lost in\\nrealizing to what creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt\\nI could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them. I\\nshuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined\\nme.\\n\\n\\'I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but\\nfound nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All\\nthe buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous\\nclimbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the\\ntall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished\\ngleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening,\\ntaking Weena like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills\\ntowards the south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or\\neight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen\\nthe place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively\\ndiminished. In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and\\na nail was working through the sole--they were comfortable old shoes\\nI wore about indoors--so that I was lame. And it was already long\\npast sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black\\nagainst the pale yellow of the sky.\\n\\n\\'Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but\\nafter a while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the\\nside of me, occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers\\nto stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at\\nthe last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vase\\nfor floral decoration. At least she utilized them for that purpose.\\nAnd that reminds me! In changing my jacket I found...\\'\\n\\nThe Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and\\nsilently placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white\\nmallows, upon the little table. Then he resumed his narrative.\\n\\n\\'As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over\\nthe hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to\\nreturn to the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant\\npinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to\\nmake her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her\\nFear. You know that great pause that comes upon things before the\\ndusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees. To me there is always an\\nair of expectation about that evening stillness. The sky was clear,\\nremote, and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the\\nsunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my\\nfears. In that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally\\nsharpened. I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of the ground\\nbeneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the Morlocks\\non their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark.\\nIn my excitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of\\ntheir burrows as a declaration of war. And why had they taken my\\nTime Machine?\\n\\n\\'So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night.\\nThe clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another\\ncame out. The ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena\\'s fears and\\nher fatigue grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her\\nand caressed her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her\\narms round my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face\\nagainst my shoulder. So we went down a long slope into a valley, and\\nthere in the dimness I almost walked into a little river. This I\\nwaded, and went up the opposite side of the valley, past a number\\nof sleeping houses, and by a statue--a Faun, or some such figure,\\n_minus_ the head. Here too were acacias. So far I had seen nothing of\\nthe Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and the darker hours\\nbefore the old moon rose were still to come.\\n\\n\\'From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide\\nand black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to\\nit, either to the right or the left. Feeling tired--my feet, in\\nparticular, were very sore--I carefully lowered Weena from my\\nshoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I could no\\nlonger see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my\\ndirection. I looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of\\nwhat it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches one would\\nbe out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other lurking\\ndanger--a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose\\nupon--there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the\\ntree-boles to strike against.\\n\\n\\'I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so I\\ndecided that I would not face it, but would pass the night upon the\\nopen hill.\\n\\n\\'Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her\\nin my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The\\nhill-side was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood\\nthere came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the\\nstars, for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of\\nfriendly comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations\\nhad gone from the sky, however: that slow movement which is\\nimperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had long since\\nrearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, it\\nseemed to me, was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as\\nof yore. Southward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star that\\nwas new to me; it was even more splendid than our own green Sirius.\\nAnd amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet\\nshone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend.\\n\\n\\'Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all\\nthe gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable\\ndistance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of\\nthe unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great\\nprecessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty\\ntimes had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that\\nI had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity,\\nall the traditions, the complex organizations, the nations,\\nlanguages, literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as\\nI knew him, had been swept out of existence. Instead were these\\nfrail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white\\nThings of which I went in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear\\nthat was between the two species, and for the first time, with a\\nsudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen\\nmight be. Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping\\nbeside me, her face white and starlike under the stars, and\\nforthwith dismissed the thought.\\n\\n\\'Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as\\nI could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find\\nsigns of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept\\nvery clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at\\ntimes. Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward\\nsky, like the reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon\\nrose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking\\nit, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then\\ngrowing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had\\nseen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence of renewed\\nday it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable. I\\nstood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle\\nand painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took off my shoes,\\nand flung them away.\\n\\n\\'I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and\\npleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit\\nwherewith to break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones,\\nlaughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such\\nthing in nature as the night. And then I thought once more of the\\nmeat that I had seen. I felt assured now of what it was, and from\\nthe bottom of my heart I pitied this last feeble rill from the great\\nflood of humanity. Clearly, at some time in the Long-Ago of human\\ndecay the Morlocks\\' food had run short. Possibly they had lived on\\nrats and such-like vermin. Even now man is far less discriminating\\nand exclusive in his food than he was--far less than any monkey. His\\nprejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct. And so\\nthese inhuman sons of men----! I tried to look at the thing in a\\nscientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more remote\\nthan our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago.\\nAnd the intelligence that would have made this state of things a\\ntorment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These Eloi were mere\\nfatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed\\nupon--probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena dancing\\nat my side!\\n\\n\\'Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming\\nupon me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human\\nselfishness. Man had been content to live in ease and delight upon\\nthe labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword\\nand excuse, and in the fullness of time Necessity had come home to\\nhim. I even tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy\\nin decay. But this attitude of mind was impossible. However great\\ntheir intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the\\nhuman form not to claim my sympathy, and to make me perforce a\\nsharer in their degradation and their Fear.\\n\\n\\'I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should\\npursue. My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to\\nmake myself such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That\\nnecessity was immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some\\nmeans of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand,\\nfor nothing, I knew, would be more efficient against these Morlocks.\\nThen I wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of\\nbronze under the White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had\\na persuasion that if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of\\nlight before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape. I\\ncould not imagine the Morlocks were strong enough to move it far\\naway. Weena I had resolved to bring with me to our own time. And\\nturning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards the\\nbuilding which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\n\\n\\'I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about\\nnoon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass\\nremained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had\\nfallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high\\nupon a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I\\nwas surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged\\nWandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then--though\\nI never followed up the thought--of what might have happened, or\\nmight be happening, to the living things in the sea.\\n\\n\\'The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed\\nporcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some\\nunknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might\\nhelp me to interpret this, but I only learned that the bare idea of\\nwriting had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I\\nfancy, more human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so\\nhuman.\\n\\n\\'Within the big valves of the door--which were open and broken--we\\nfound, instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many\\nside windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum.\\nThe tiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable array of\\nmiscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering. Then\\nI perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall,\\nwhat was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognized\\nby the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the\\nfashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper bones lay\\nbeside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had\\ndropped through a leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn\\naway. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a\\nBrontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the\\nside I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away\\nthe thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own\\ntime. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair\\npreservation of some of their contents.\\n\\n\\'Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South\\nKensington! Here, apparently, was the Palaeontological Section,\\nand a very splendid array of fossils it must have been, though the\\ninevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time, and\\nhad, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine\\nhundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if\\nwith extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures. Here and\\nthere I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare\\nfossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds. And the\\ncases had in some instances been bodily removed--by the Morlocks as\\nI judged. The place was very silent. The thick dust deadened our\\nfootsteps. Weena, who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping\\nglass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and very\\nquietly took my hand and stood beside me.\\n\\n\\'And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an\\nintellectual age, that I gave no thought to the possibilities it\\npresented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a\\nlittle from my mind.\\n\\n\\'To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain\\nhad a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palaeontology;\\npossibly historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me,\\nat least in my present circumstances, these would be vastly more\\ninteresting than this spectacle of oldtime geology in decay.\\nExploring, I found another short gallery running transversely to the\\nfirst. This appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of a\\nblock of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder. But I could find\\nno saltpeter; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had\\ndeliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a\\ntrain of thinking. As for the rest of the contents of that gallery,\\nthough on the whole they were the best preserved of all I saw, I had\\nlittle interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on\\ndown a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had\\nentered. Apparently this section had been devoted to natural\\nhistory, but everything had long since passed out of recognition. A\\nfew shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed\\nanimals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit, a\\nbrown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for that,\\nbecause I should have been glad to trace the patent readjustments by\\nwhich the conquest of animated nature had been attained. Then we\\ncame to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly\\nill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the\\nend at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from the\\nceiling--many of them cracked and smashed--which suggested that\\noriginally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in\\nmy element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of\\nbig machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some\\nstill fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for\\nmechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these; the more so as\\nfor the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make\\nonly the vaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if\\nI could solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession of\\npowers that might be of use against the Morlocks.\\n\\n\\'Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she\\nstartled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have\\nnoticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It\\nmay be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum\\nwas built into the side of a hill.--ED.] The end I had come in at\\nwas quite above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As\\nyou went down the length, the ground came up against these windows,\\nuntil at last there was a pit like the \"area\" of a London house\\nbefore each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went\\nslowly along, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent\\nupon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light, until\\nWeena\\'s increasing apprehensions drew my attention. Then I saw that\\nthe gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. I hesitated, and\\nthen, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant\\nand its surface less even. Further away towards the dimness, it\\nappeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints. My\\nsense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that.\\nI felt that I was wasting my time in the academic examination of\\nmachinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the\\nafternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means\\nof making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of the\\ngallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had\\nheard down the well.\\n\\n\\'I took Weena\\'s hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her\\nand turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike\\nthose in a signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this\\nlever in my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly\\nWeena, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged\\nthe strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a\\nminute\\'s strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than\\nsufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I\\nlonged very much to kill a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may\\nthink, to want to go killing one\\'s own descendants! But it was\\nimpossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only my\\ndisinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if I began to\\nslake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer, restrained\\nme from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes I\\nheard.\\n\\n\\'Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that\\ngallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first\\nglance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags.\\nThe brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I\\npresently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books. They had\\nlong since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left\\nthem. But here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic\\nclasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I\\nmight, perhaps, have moralized upon the futility of all ambition.\\nBut as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force was the\\nenormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting\\npaper testified. At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly\\nof the _Philosophical Transactions_ and my own seventeen papers upon\\nphysical optics.\\n\\n\\'Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have\\nbeen a gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little\\nhope of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had\\ncollapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every\\nunbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases,\\nI found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were\\nperfectly good. They were not even damp. I turned to Weena. \"Dance,\"\\nI cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed\\nagainst the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in that derelict\\nmuseum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena\\'s huge\\ndelight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling\\n_The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a\\nmodest _cancan_, in part a step dance, in part a skirt-dance (so far\\nas my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally\\ninventive, as you know.\\n\\n\\'Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped\\nthe wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for\\nme it was a most fortunate thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far\\nunlikelier substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed\\njar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed.\\nI fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass\\naccordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the\\nuniversal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive,\\nperhaps through many thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a\\nsepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil\\nBelemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millions\\nof years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that\\nit was inflammable and burned with a good bright flame--was, in\\nfact, an excellent candle--and I put it in my pocket. I found no\\nexplosives, however, nor any means of breaking down the bronze\\ndoors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had\\nchanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated.\\n\\n\\'I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would\\nrequire a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all\\nthe proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of\\narms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a\\nsword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised\\nbest against the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols,\\nand rifles. The most were masses of rust, but many were of some\\nnew metal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder\\nthere may once have been had rotted into dust. One corner I saw was\\ncharred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the\\nspecimens. In another place was a vast array of idols--Polynesian,\\nMexican, Grecian, Phoenician, every country on earth I should think.\\nAnd here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name upon\\nthe nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularly\\ntook my fancy.\\n\\n\\'As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery\\nafter gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes\\nmere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I\\nsuddenly found myself near the model of a tin-mine, and then by the\\nmerest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite\\ncartridges! I shouted \"Eureka!\" and smashed the case with joy. Then\\ncame a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery,\\nI made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in\\nwaiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came.\\nOf course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from\\ntheir presence. I really believe that had they not been so, I should\\nhave rushed off incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and\\n(as it proved) my chances of finding the Time Machine, all together\\ninto non-existence.\\n\\n\\'It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court\\nwithin the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we\\nrested and refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider\\nour position. Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible\\nhiding-place had still to be found. But that troubled me very little\\nnow. I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of\\nall defences against the Morlocks--I had matches! I had the camphor\\nin my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed. It seemed to me that\\nthe best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open,\\nprotected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of the\\nTime Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my iron mace. But\\nnow, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently towards\\nthose bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them,\\nlargely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never\\nimpressed me as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of\\niron not altogether inadequate for the work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX\\n\\n\\n\\'We emerged from the palace while the sun was still in part above\\nthe horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the\\nnext morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods\\nthat had stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as\\nfar as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep\\nin the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I\\ngathered any sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms\\nfull of such litter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had\\nanticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I began to suffer from\\nsleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the\\nwood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped,\\nfearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending\\ncalamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me\\nonward. I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and I was\\nfeverish and irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the\\nMorlocks with it.\\n\\n\\'While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim\\nagainst their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was\\nscrub and long grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from\\ntheir insidious approach. The forest, I calculated, was rather\\nless than a mile across. If we could get through it to the bare\\nhill-side, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether safer\\nresting-place; I thought that with my matches and my camphor I could\\ncontrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods. Yet it was\\nevident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should\\nhave to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down.\\nAnd then it came into my head that I would amaze our friends behind\\nby lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of this\\nproceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering\\nour retreat.\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must\\nbe in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun\\'s\\nheat is rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by\\ndewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts.\\nLightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to\\nwidespread fire. Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with\\nthe heat of its fermentation, but this rarely results in flame. In\\nthis decadence, too, the art of fire-making had been forgotten on\\nthe earth. The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were\\nan altogether new and strange thing to Weena.\\n\\n\\'She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have\\ncast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up,\\nand in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the\\nwood. For a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking\\nback presently, I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my\\nheap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a\\ncurved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed\\nat that, and turned again to the dark trees before me. It was very\\nblack, and Weena clung to me convulsively, but there was still, as\\nmy eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for me to\\navoid the stems. Overhead it was simply black, except where a gap of\\nremote blue sky shone down upon us here and there. I struck none of\\nmy matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left arm I carried my\\nlittle one, in my right hand I had my iron bar.\\n\\n\\'For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet,\\nthe faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the\\nthrob of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a\\npattering about me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more\\ndistinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had\\nheard in the Under-world. There were evidently several of the\\nMorlocks, and they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another\\nminute I felt a tug at my coat, then something at my arm. And Weena\\nshivered violently, and became quite still.\\n\\n\\'It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did\\nso, and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the\\ndarkness about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the\\nsame peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands,\\ntoo, were creeping over my coat and back, touching even my neck.\\nThen the match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the\\nwhite backs of the Morlocks in flight amid the trees. I hastily took\\na lump of camphor from my pocket, and prepared to light it as soon\\nas the match should wane. Then I looked at Weena. She was lying\\nclutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face to the ground.\\nWith a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely to\\nbreathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground,\\nand as it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the\\nshadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full of\\nthe stir and murmur of a great company!\\n\\n\\'She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder\\nand rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realization. In\\nmanoeuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about\\nseveral times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction\\nlay my path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the\\nPalace of Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to\\nthink rapidly what to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp\\nwhere we were. I put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy\\nbole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I began\\ncollecting sticks and leaves. Here and there out of the darkness\\nround me the Morlocks\\' eyes shone like carbuncles.\\n\\n\\'The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so,\\ntwo white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away.\\nOne was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I\\nfelt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of\\ndismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece\\nof camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed\\nhow dry was some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival\\non the Time Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So,\\ninstead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began\\nleaping up and dragging down branches. Very soon I had a choking\\nsmoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and could economize my\\ncamphor. Then I turned to where Weena lay beside my iron mace. I\\ntried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I could\\nnot even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.\\n\\n\\'Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have\\nmade me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in\\nthe air. My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I\\nfelt very weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was\\nfull of a slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just\\nto nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had\\ntheir hands upon me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily\\nfelt in my pocket for the match-box, and--it had gone! Then they\\ngripped and closed with me again. In a moment I knew what had\\nhappened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitterness\\nof death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the smell of\\nburning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms,\\nand pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to\\nfeel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in\\na monstrous spider\\'s web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt\\nlittle teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my\\nhand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I struggled\\nup, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short,\\nI thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the\\nsucculent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment\\nI was free.\\n\\n\\'The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard\\nfighting came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I\\ndetermined to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my\\nback to a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was\\nfull of the stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices\\nseemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements\\ngrew faster. Yet none came within reach. I stood glaring at the\\nblackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks were\\nafraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing. The\\ndarkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see the\\nMorlocks about me--three battered at my feet--and then I recognized,\\nwith incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in an\\nincessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the\\nwood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish.\\nAs I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap\\nof starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I\\nunderstood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was\\ngrowing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks\\'\\nflight.\\n\\n\\'Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through\\nthe black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning\\nforest. It was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for\\nWeena, but she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the\\nexplosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little\\ntime for reflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the\\nMorlocks\\' path. It was a close race. Once the flames crept forward\\nso swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had to\\nstrike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open\\nspace, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and\\npast me, and went on straight into the fire!\\n\\n\\'And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of\\nall that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright\\nas day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock\\nor tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was\\nanother arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already\\nwrithing from it, completely encircling the space with a fence of\\nfire. Upon the hill-side were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled\\nby the light and heat, and blundering hither and thither against\\neach other in their bewilderment. At first I did not realize their\\nblindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of\\nfear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more.\\nBut when I had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the\\nhawthorn against the red sky, and heard their moans, I was assured\\nof their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I struck\\nno more of them.\\n\\n\\'Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting\\nloose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one\\ntime the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures\\nwould presently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the\\nfight by killing some of them before this should happen; but the\\nfire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about\\nthe hill among them and avoided them, looking for some trace of\\nWeena. But Weena was gone.\\n\\n\\'At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this\\nstrange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and\\nmaking uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat\\non them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and\\nthrough the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they\\nbelonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three\\nMorlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows\\nof my fists, trembling as I did so.\\n\\n\\'For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare.\\nI bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat\\nthe ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and\\nwandered here and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to\\nrubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw\\nMorlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the\\nflames. But, at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above the\\nstreaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening\\ntree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures,\\ncame the white light of the day.\\n\\n\\'I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was\\nplain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I\\ncannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the\\nawful fate to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was\\nalmost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about\\nme, but I contained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind\\nof island in the forest. From its summit I could now make out\\nthrough a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that\\nI could get my bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the\\nremnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and\\nmoaning, as the day grew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet\\nand limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems, that still\\npulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of the Time\\nMachine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well as\\nlame, and I felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death\\nof little Weena. It seemed an overwhelming calamity. Now, in this\\nold familiar room, it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an\\nactual loss. But that morning it left me absolutely lonely\\nagain--terribly alone. I began to think of this house of mine, of\\nthis fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longing\\nthat was pain.\\n\\n\\'But as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning\\nsky, I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose\\nmatches. The box must have leaked before it was lost.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\'About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of\\nyellow metal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of\\nmy arrival. I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and\\ncould not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Here\\nwas the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same\\nsplendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver river\\nrunning between its fertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful\\npeople moved hither and thither among the trees. Some were bathing\\nin exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and that suddenly gave\\nme a keen stab of pain. And like blots upon the landscape rose the\\ncupolas above the ways to the Under-world. I understood now what all\\nthe beauty of the Over-world people covered. Very pleasant was their\\nday, as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field. Like the\\ncattle, they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs. And\\ntheir end was the same.\\n\\n\\'I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had\\nbeen. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly\\ntowards comfort and ease, a balanced society with security and\\npermanency as its watchword, it had attained its hopes--to come\\nto this at last. Once, life and property must have reached almost\\nabsolute safety. The rich had been assured of his wealth and\\ncomfort, the toiler assured of his life and work. No doubt in that\\nperfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social\\nquestion left unsolved. And a great quiet had followed.\\n\\n\\'It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility\\nis the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal\\nperfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism.\\nNature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are\\nuseless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no\\nneed of change. Only those animals partake of intelligence that have\\nto meet a huge variety of needs and dangers.\\n\\n\\'So, as I see it, the Upper-world man had drifted towards his\\nfeeble prettiness, and the Under-world to mere mechanical industry.\\nBut that perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical\\nperfection--absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, the\\nfeeding of the Under-world, however it was effected, had become\\ndisjointed. Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a\\nfew thousand years, came back again, and she began below. The\\nUnder-world being in contact with machinery, which, however perfect,\\nstill needs some little thought outside habit, had probably retained\\nperforce rather more initiative, if less of every other human\\ncharacter, than the Upper. And when other meat failed them, they\\nturned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden. So I say I saw it\\nin my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven\\nHundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit\\ncould invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and as that I\\ngive it to you.\\n\\n\\'After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and\\nin spite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm\\nsunlight were very pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon\\nmy theorizing passed into dozing. Catching myself at that, I took my\\nown hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and\\nrefreshing sleep.\\n\\n\\'I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being\\ncaught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on\\ndown the hill towards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one\\nhand, and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket.\\n\\n\\'And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal\\nof the sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid\\ndown into grooves.\\n\\n\\'At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.\\n\\n\\'Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner\\nof this was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket.\\nSo here, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the\\nWhite Sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost\\nsorry not to use it.\\n\\n\\'A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal.\\nFor once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks.\\nSuppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the\\nbronze frame and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it\\nhad been carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that\\nthe Morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in\\ntheir dim way to grasp its purpose.\\n\\n\\'Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere\\ntouch of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The\\nbronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang.\\nI was in the dark--trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I\\nchuckled gleefully.\\n\\n\\'I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards\\nme. Very calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on\\nthe levers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one\\nlittle thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light\\nonly on the box.\\n\\n\\'You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were\\nclose upon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at\\nthem with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the\\nmachine. Then came one hand upon me and then another. Then I had\\nsimply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers, and\\nat the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One,\\nindeed, they almost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand,\\nI had to butt in the dark with my head--I could hear the Morlock\\'s\\nskull ring--to recover it. It was a nearer thing than the fight in\\nthe forest, I think, this last scramble.\\n\\n\\'But at last the lever was fitted and pulled over. The clinging\\nhands slipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes.\\nI found myself in the same grey light and tumult I have already\\ndescribed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXI\\n\\n\\n\\'I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes\\nwith time travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the\\nsaddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite\\ntime I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite\\nunheeding how I went, and when I brought myself to look at the dials\\nagain I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dial records\\ndays, and another thousands of days, another millions of days, and\\nanother thousands of millions. Now, instead of reversing the levers,\\nI had pulled them over so as to go forward with them, and when I\\ncame to look at these indicators I found that the thousands hand was\\nsweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch--into\\nfuturity.\\n\\n\\'As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of\\nthings. The palpitating greyness grew darker; then--though I was\\nstill travelling with prodigious velocity--the blinking succession\\nof day and night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace,\\nreturned, and grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much\\nat first. The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower,\\nand so did the passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed\\nto stretch through centuries. At last a steady twilight brooded over\\nthe earth, a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared\\nacross the darkling sky. The band of light that had indicated the\\nsun had long since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set--it\\nsimply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broader and more\\nred. All trace of the moon had vanished. The circling of the stars,\\ngrowing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of\\nlight. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very\\nlarge, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with\\na dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction. At\\none time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again,\\nbut it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by this\\nslowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal\\ndrag was done. The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun,\\neven as in our own time the moon faces the earth. Very cautiously,\\nfor I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to reverse\\nmy motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands until the\\nthousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a\\nmere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of a\\ndesolate beach grew visible.\\n\\n\\'I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round.\\nThe sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black,\\nand out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale\\nwhite stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and\\nsouth-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by\\nthe horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The\\nrocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of\\nlife that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation\\nthat covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It\\nwas the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the\\nlichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual\\ntwilight.\\n\\n\\'The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away\\nto the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the\\nwan sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of\\nwind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a\\ngentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving\\nand living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was\\na thick incrustation of salt--pink under the lurid sky. There was a\\nsense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing\\nvery fast. The sensation reminded me of my only experience of\\nmountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied\\nthan it is now.\\n\\n\\'Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a\\nthing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into\\nthe sky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The\\nsound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself\\nmore firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that,\\nquite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving\\nslowly towards me. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous\\ncrab-like creature. Can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table,\\nwith its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws\\nswaying, its long antennae, like carters\\' whips, waving and feeling,\\nand its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic\\nfront? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses,\\nand a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could see\\nthe many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it\\nmoved.\\n\\n\\'As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt\\na tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to\\nbrush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost\\nimmediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught\\nsomething threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a\\nfrightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna\\nof another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes\\nwere wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with\\nappetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime,\\nwere descending upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and\\nI had placed a month between myself and these monsters. But I was\\nstill on the same beach, and I saw them distinctly now as soon as I\\nstopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there, in the\\nsombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green.\\n\\n\\'I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over\\nthe world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt\\nDead Sea, the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring\\nmonsters, the uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous\\nplants, the thin air that hurts one\\'s lungs: all contributed to an\\nappalling effect. I moved on a hundred years, and there was the same\\nred sun--a little larger, a little duller--the same dying sea, the\\nsame chill air, and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in\\nand out among the green weed and the red rocks. And in the westward\\nsky, I saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon.\\n\\n\\'So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a\\nthousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth\\'s fate,\\nwatching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller\\nin the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At\\nlast, more than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of\\nthe sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling\\nheavens. Then I stopped once more, for the crawling multitude of\\ncrabs had disappeared, and the red beach, save for its livid green\\nliverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with\\nwhite. A bitter cold assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again\\ncame eddying down. To the north-eastward, the glare of snow lay\\nunder the starlight of the sable sky and I could see an undulating\\ncrest of hillocks pinkish white. There were fringes of ice along the\\nsea margin, with drifting masses further out; but the main expanse\\nof that salt ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still\\nunfrozen.\\n\\n\\'I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A\\ncertain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the\\nmachine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green\\nslime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A\\nshallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded\\nfrom the beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about\\nupon this bank, but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I\\njudged that my eye had been deceived, and that the black object was\\nmerely a rock. The stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed\\nto me to twinkle very little.\\n\\n\\'Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun\\nhad changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I\\nsaw this grow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this\\nblackness that was creeping over the day, and then I realized that\\nan eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was\\npassing across the sun\\'s disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be\\nthe moon, but there is much to incline me to believe that what I\\nreally saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to\\nthe earth.\\n\\n\\'The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening\\ngusts from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air\\nincreased in number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and\\nwhisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent?\\nIt would be hard to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of\\nman, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects,\\nthe stir that makes the background of our lives--all that was over.\\nAs the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more abundant,\\ndancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense. At\\nlast, one by one, swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks of\\nthe distant hills vanished into blackness. The breeze rose to a\\nmoaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping\\ntowards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were visible. All\\nelse was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black.\\n\\n\\'A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote\\nto my marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I\\nshivered, and a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow\\nin the sky appeared the edge of the sun. I got off the machine to\\nrecover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return\\njourney. As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing\\nupon the shoal--there was no mistake now that it was a moving\\nthing--against the red water of the sea. It was a round thing, the\\nsize of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentacles\\ntrailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering\\nblood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt I\\nwas fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote\\nand awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXII\\n\\n\\n\\'So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon\\nthe machine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was\\nresumed, the sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with\\ngreater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and\\nflowed. The hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again\\nthe dim shadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity.\\nThese, too, changed and passed, and others came. Presently, when the\\nmillion dial was at zero, I slackened speed. I began to recognize\\nour own pretty and familiar architecture, the thousands hand ran back\\nto the starting-point, the night and day flapped slower and slower.\\nThen the old walls of the laboratory came round me. Very gently,\\nnow, I slowed the mechanism down.\\n\\n\\'I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told\\nyou that when I set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs.\\nWatchett had walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me,\\nlike a rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when\\nshe traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to\\nbe the exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower\\nend opened, and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost,\\nand disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered.\\nJust before that I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed\\nlike a flash.\\n\\n\\'Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar\\nlaboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got\\noff the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several\\nminutes I trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was\\nmy old workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept\\nthere, and the whole thing have been a dream.\\n\\n\\'And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east\\ncorner of the laboratory. It had come to rest again in the\\nnorth-west, against the wall where you saw it. That gives you the\\nexact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the White\\nSphinx, into which the Morlocks had carried my machine.\\n\\n\\'For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came\\nthrough the passage here, limping, because my heel was still\\npainful, and feeling sorely begrimed. I saw the _Pall Mall Gazette_\\non the table by the door. I found the date was indeed to-day, and\\nlooking at the timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o\\'clock. I\\nheard your voices and the clatter of plates. I hesitated--I felt so\\nsick and weak. Then I sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the\\ndoor on you. You know the rest. I washed, and dined, and now I am\\ntelling you the story.\\n\\n\\'I know,\\' he said, after a pause, \\'that all this will be absolutely\\nincredible to you. To me the one incredible thing is that I am here\\nto-night in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces\\nand telling you these strange adventures.\\'\\n\\nHe looked at the Medical Man. \\'No. I cannot expect you to believe\\nit. Take it as a lie--or a prophecy. Say I dreamed it in the\\nworkshop. Consider I have been speculating upon the destinies of our\\nrace until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my assertion of its\\ntruth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest. And taking\\nit as a story, what do you think of it?\\'\\n\\nHe took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap\\nwith it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary\\nstillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the\\ncarpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller\\'s face, and looked\\nround at his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of\\ncolour swam before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the\\ncontemplation of our host. The Editor was looking hard at the end\\nof his cigar--the sixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The\\nothers, as far as I remember, were motionless.\\n\\nThe Editor stood up with a sigh. \\'What a pity it is you\\'re not\\na writer of stories!\\' he said, putting his hand on the Time\\nTraveller\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n\\'You don\\'t believe it?\\'\\n\\n\\'Well----\\'\\n\\n\\'I thought not.\\'\\n\\nThe Time Traveller turned to us. \\'Where are the matches?\\' he said.\\nHe lit one and spoke over his pipe, puffing. \\'To tell you the truth\\n... I hardly believe it myself.... And yet...\\'\\n\\nHis eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers\\nupon the little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his\\npipe, and I saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his\\nknuckles.\\n\\nThe Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers.\\n\\'The gynaeceum\\'s odd,\\' he said. The Psychologist leant forward to\\nsee, holding out his hand for a specimen.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m hanged if it isn\\'t a quarter to one,\\' said the Journalist.\\n\\'How shall we get home?\\'\\n\\n\\'Plenty of cabs at the station,\\' said the Psychologist.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s a curious thing,\\' said the Medical Man; \\'but I certainly don\\'t\\nknow the natural order of these flowers. May I have them?\\'\\n\\nThe Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: \\'Certainly not.\\'\\n\\n\\'Where did you really get them?\\' said the Medical Man.\\n\\nThe Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who\\nwas trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. \\'They were put\\ninto my pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.\\' He stared\\nround the room. \\'I\\'m damned if it isn\\'t all going. This room and you\\nand the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory. Did I\\never make a Time Machine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all\\nonly a dream? They say life is a dream, a precious poor dream at\\ntimes--but I can\\'t stand another that won\\'t fit. It\\'s madness. And\\nwhere did the dream come from? ... I must look at that machine. If\\nthere is one!\\'\\n\\nHe caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through\\nthe door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering\\nlight of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and\\naskew; a thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering\\nquartz. Solid to the touch--for I put out my hand and felt the rail\\nof it--and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of\\ngrass and moss upon the lower parts, and one rail bent awry.\\n\\nThe Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand\\nalong the damaged rail. \\'It\\'s all right now,\\' he said. \\'The story I\\ntold you was true. I\\'m sorry to have brought you out here in the\\ncold.\\' He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we\\nreturned to the smoking-room.\\n\\nHe came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his\\ncoat. The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain\\nhesitation, told him he was suffering from overwork, at which he\\nlaughed hugely. I remember him standing in the open doorway, bawling\\ngood night.\\n\\nI shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a \\'gaudy lie.\\'\\nFor my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was\\nso fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I\\nlay awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go\\nnext day and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the\\nlaboratory, and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him.\\nThe laboratory, however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the\\nTime Machine and put out my hand and touched the lever. At that the\\nsquat substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the\\nwind. Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer\\nreminiscence of the childish days when I used to be forbidden to\\nmeddle. I came back through the corridor. The Time Traveller met me\\nin the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had a small\\ncamera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed when\\nhe saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. \\'I\\'m frightfully busy,\\'\\nsaid he, \\'with that thing in there.\\'\\n\\n\\'But is it not some hoax?\\' I said. \\'Do you really travel through\\ntime?\\'\\n\\n\\'Really and truly I do.\\' And he looked frankly into my eyes. He\\nhesitated. His eye wandered about the room. \\'I only want half an\\nhour,\\' he said. \\'I know why you came, and it\\'s awfully good of you.\\nThere\\'s some magazines here. If you\\'ll stop to lunch I\\'ll prove you\\nthis time travelling up to the hilt, specimen and all. If you\\'ll\\nforgive my leaving you now?\\'\\n\\nI consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,\\nand he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of\\nthe laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily\\npaper. What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly\\nI was reminded by an advertisement that I had promised to meet\\nRichardson, the publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw\\nthat I could barely save that engagement. I got up and went down the\\npassage to tell the Time Traveller.\\n\\nAs I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation,\\noddly truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air\\nwhirled round me as I opened the door, and from within came the\\nsound of broken glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was\\nnot there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in\\na whirling mass of black and brass for a moment--a figure so\\ntransparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was\\nabsolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes.\\nThe Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the\\nfurther end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had,\\napparently, just been blown in.\\n\\nI felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had\\nhappened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange\\nthing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,\\nand the man-servant appeared.\\n\\nWe looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. \\'Has Mr. ----\\ngone out that way?\\' said I.\\n\\n\\'No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him\\nhere.\\'\\n\\nAt that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I\\nstayed on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second,\\nperhaps still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he\\nwould bring with him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must\\nwait a lifetime. The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And,\\nas everybody knows now, he has never returned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEPILOGUE\\n\\n\\nOne cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he\\nswept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy\\nsavages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the\\nCretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian\\nbrutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now--if I may use the\\nphrase--be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral\\nreef, or beside the lonely saline lakes of the Triassic Age. Or did\\nhe go forward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still\\nmen, but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome\\nproblems solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own\\npart, cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment,\\nfragmentary theory, and mutual discord are indeed man\\'s culminating\\ntime! I say, for my own part. He, I know--for the question had been\\ndiscussed among us long before the Time Machine was made--thought\\nbut cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the\\ngrowing pile of civilization only a foolish heaping that must\\ninevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end. If that\\nis so, it remains for us to live as though it were not so. But to me\\nthe future is still black and blank--is a vast ignorance, lit at a\\nfew casual places by the memory of his story. And I have by me, for\\nmy comfort, two strange white flowers--shrivelled now, and brown and\\nflat and brittle--to witness that even when mind and strength had\\ngone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart\\nof man.\\n'"

              "'The Time Machine, by H. G. Wells [1898]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\n\\nThe Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him)\\nwas expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and\\ntwinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The\\nfire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent\\nlights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and\\npassed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and\\ncaressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that\\nluxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought roams gracefully\\nfree of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this\\nway--marking the points with a lean forefinger--as we sat and lazily\\nadmired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it)\\nand his fecundity.\\n\\n\\'You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two\\nideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for\\ninstance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.\\'\\n\\n\\'Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?\\'\\nsaid Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.\\n\\n\\'I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable\\nground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You\\nknow of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_,\\nhas no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a\\nmathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.\\'\\n\\n\\'That is all right,\\' said the Psychologist.\\n\\n\\'Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a\\nreal existence.\\'\\n\\n\\'There I object,\\' said Filby. \\'Of course a solid body may exist. All\\nreal things--\\'\\n\\n\\'So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_\\ncube exist?\\'\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t follow you,\\' said Filby.\\n\\n\\'Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real\\nexistence?\\'\\n\\nFilby became pensive. \\'Clearly,\\' the Time Traveller proceeded, \\'any\\nreal body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have\\nLength, Breadth, Thickness, and--Duration. But through a natural\\ninfirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we\\nincline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions,\\nthree which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time.\\nThere is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between\\nthe former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that\\nour consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the\\nlatter from the beginning to the end of our lives.\\'\\n\\n\\'That,\\' said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight\\nhis cigar over the lamp; \\'that ... very clear indeed.\\'\\n\\n\\'Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,\\'\\ncontinued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of\\ncheerfulness. \\'Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension,\\nthough some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know\\nthey mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. _There is\\nno difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space\\nexcept that our consciousness moves along it_. But some foolish\\npeople have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all\\nheard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?\\'\\n\\n\\'_I_ have not,\\' said the Provincial Mayor.\\n\\n\\'It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is\\nspoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,\\nBreadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to\\nthree planes, each at right angles to the others. But some\\nphilosophical people have been asking why _three_ dimensions\\nparticularly--why not another direction at right angles to the other\\nthree?--and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimension geometry.\\nProfessor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York\\nMathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know how on a flat\\nsurface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of\\na three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models\\nof three dimensions they could represent one of four--if they could\\nmaster the perspective of the thing. See?\\'\\n\\n\\'I think so,\\' murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his\\nbrows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one\\nwho repeats mystic words. \\'Yes, I think I see it now,\\' he said after\\nsome time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.\\n\\n\\'Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this\\ngeometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results\\nare curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight\\nyears old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at\\ntwenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it\\nwere, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned\\nbeing, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.\\n\\n\\'Scientific people,\\' proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause\\nrequired for the proper assimilation of this, \\'know very well that\\nTime is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram,\\na weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the\\nmovement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night\\nit fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to\\nhere. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the\\ndimensions of Space generally recognized? But certainly it traced\\nsuch a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude was along\\nthe Time-Dimension.\\'\\n\\n\\'But,\\' said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, \\'if\\nTime is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why\\nhas it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot\\nwe move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?\\'\\n\\nThe Time Traveller smiled. \\'Are you sure we can move freely in\\nSpace? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,\\nand men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two\\ndimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.\\'\\n\\n\\'Not exactly,\\' said the Medical Man. \\'There are balloons.\\'\\n\\n\\'But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the\\ninequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical\\nmovement.\\'\\n\\n\\'Still they could move a little up and down,\\' said the Medical Man.\\n\\n\\'Easier, far easier down than up.\\'\\n\\n\\'And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the\\npresent moment.\\'\\n\\n\\'My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where\\nthe whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the\\npresent moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have\\nno dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform\\nvelocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_\\nif we began our existence fifty miles above the earth\\'s surface.\\'\\n\\n\\'But the great difficulty is this,\\' interrupted the Psychologist.\\n\\'You _can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot\\nmove about in Time.\\'\\n\\n\\'That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say\\nthat we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling\\nan incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence:\\nI become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of\\ncourse we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any\\nmore than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the\\nground. But a civilized man is better off than the savage in this\\nrespect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why\\nshould he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or\\naccelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about\\nand travel the other way?\\'\\n\\n\\'Oh, _this_,\\' began Filby, \\'is all--\\'\\n\\n\\'Why not?\\' said the Time Traveller.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s against reason,\\' said Filby.\\n\\n\\'What reason?\\' said the Time Traveller.\\n\\n\\'You can show black is white by argument,\\' said Filby, \\'but you will\\nnever convince me.\\'\\n\\n\\'Possibly not,\\' said the Time Traveller. \\'But now you begin to see\\nthe object of my investigations into the geometry of Four\\nDimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine--\\'\\n\\n\\'To travel through Time!\\' exclaimed the Very Young Man.\\n\\n\\'That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time,\\nas the driver determines.\\'\\n\\nFilby contented himself with laughter.\\n\\n\\'But I have experimental verification,\\' said the Time Traveller.\\n\\n\\'It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,\\' the\\nPsychologist suggested. \\'One might travel back and verify the\\naccepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!\\'\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t you think you would attract attention?\\' said the Medical Man.\\n\\'Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.\\'\\n\\n\\'One might get one\\'s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,\\'\\nthe Very Young Man thought.\\n\\n\\'In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go.\\nThe German scholars have improved Greek so much.\\'\\n\\n\\'Then there is the future,\\' said the Very Young Man. \\'Just think!\\nOne might invest all one\\'s money, leave it to accumulate at\\ninterest, and hurry on ahead!\\'\\n\\n\\'To discover a society,\\' said I, \\'erected on a strictly communistic\\nbasis.\\'\\n\\n\\'Of all the wild extravagant theories!\\' began the Psychologist.\\n\\n\\'Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until--\\'\\n\\n\\'Experimental verification!\\' cried I. \\'You are going to verify\\n_that_?\\'\\n\\n\\'The experiment!\\' cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.\\n\\n\\'Let\\'s see your experiment anyhow,\\' said the Psychologist, \\'though\\nit\\'s all humbug, you know.\\'\\n\\nThe Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly,\\nand with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly\\nout of the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long\\npassage to his laboratory.\\n\\nThe Psychologist looked at us. \\'I wonder what he\\'s got?\\'\\n\\n\\'Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,\\' said the Medical Man, and\\nFilby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at Burslem; but\\nbefore he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and\\nFilby\\'s anecdote collapsed.\\n\\nThe thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering\\nmetallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very\\ndelicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent\\ncrystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that\\nfollows--unless his explanation is to be accepted--is an absolutely\\nunaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables that\\nwere scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with\\ntwo legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism.\\nThen he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the\\ntable was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon\\nthe model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in\\nbrass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that\\nthe room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair\\nnearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between\\nthe Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking\\nover his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched\\nhim in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. The\\nVery Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the\\nalert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however\\nsubtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played\\nupon us under these conditions.\\n\\nThe Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. \\'Well?\\'\\nsaid the Psychologist.\\n\\n\\'This little affair,\\' said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows\\nupon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus,\\n\\'is only a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through\\ntime. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there\\nis an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in\\nsome way unreal.\\' He pointed to the part with his finger. \\'Also,\\nhere is one little white lever, and here is another.\\'\\n\\nThe Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.\\n\\'It\\'s beautifully made,\\' he said.\\n\\n\\'It took two years to make,\\' retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when\\nwe had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: \\'Now I\\nwant you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over,\\nsends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses\\nthe motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller.\\nPresently I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will\\ngo. It will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a\\ngood look at the thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy\\nyourselves there is no trickery. I don\\'t want to waste this model,\\nand then be told I\\'m a quack.\\'\\n\\nThere was a minute\\'s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to\\nspeak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth\\nhis finger towards the lever. \\'No,\\' he said suddenly. \\'Lend me your\\nhand.\\' And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual\\'s\\nhand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it\\nwas the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine\\non its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am\\nabsolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of\\nwind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel\\nwas blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, became\\nindistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of\\nfaintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone--vanished! Save\\nfor the lamp the table was bare.\\n\\nEveryone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.\\n\\nThe Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked\\nunder the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully.\\n\\'Well?\\' he said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then,\\ngetting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his\\nback to us began to fill his pipe.\\n\\nWe stared at each other. \\'Look here,\\' said the Medical Man, \\'are you\\nin earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine\\nhas travelled into time?\\'\\n\\n\\'Certainly,\\' said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at\\nthe fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the\\nPsychologist\\'s face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not\\nunhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.)\\n\\'What is more, I have a big machine nearly finished in there\\'--he\\nindicated the laboratory--\\'and when that is put together I mean to\\nhave a journey on my own account.\\'\\n\\n\\'You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?\\'\\nsaid Filby.\\n\\n\\'Into the future or the past--I don\\'t, for certain, know which.\\'\\n\\nAfter an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. \\'It must have\\ngone into the past if it has gone anywhere,\\' he said.\\n\\n\\'Why?\\' said the Time Traveller.\\n\\n\\'Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it\\ntravelled into the future it would still be here all this time,\\nsince it must have travelled through this time.\\'\\n\\n\\'But,\\' I said, \\'If it travelled into the past it would have been\\nvisible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we\\nwere here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!\\'\\n\\n\\'Serious objections,\\' remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of\\nimpartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.\\n\\n\\'Not a bit,\\' said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: \\'You\\nthink. You can explain that. It\\'s presentation below the threshold,\\nyou know, diluted presentation.\\'\\n\\n\\'Of course,\\' said the Psychologist, and reassured us. \\'That\\'s a\\nsimple point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It\\'s plain\\nenough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor\\ncan we appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of\\na wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is\\ntravelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than\\nwe are, if it gets through a minute while we get through a second,\\nthe impression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or\\none-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in\\ntime. That\\'s plain enough.\\' He passed his hand through the space in\\nwhich the machine had been. \\'You see?\\' he said, laughing.\\n\\nWe sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the\\nTime Traveller asked us what we thought of it all.\\n\\n\\'It sounds plausible enough to-night,\\' said the Medical Man; \\'but\\nwait until to-morrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.\\'\\n\\n\\'Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?\\' asked the Time\\nTraveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the\\nway down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember\\nvividly the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette,\\nthe dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but\\nincredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger\\nedition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before\\nour eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly\\nbeen filed or sawn out of rock crystal. The thing was generally\\ncomplete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the\\nbench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a better\\nlook at it. Quartz it seemed to be.\\n\\n\\'Look here,\\' said the Medical Man, \\'are you perfectly serious?\\nOr is this a trick--like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?\\'\\n\\n\\'Upon that machine,\\' said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp\\naloft, \\'I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more\\nserious in my life.\\'\\n\\nNone of us quite knew how to take it.\\n\\nI caught Filby\\'s eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he\\nwinked at me solemnly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\n\\nI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time\\nMachine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who\\nare too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round\\nhim; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in\\nambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and\\nexplained the matter in the Time Traveller\\'s words, we should have\\nshown _him_ far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his\\nmotives; a pork butcher could understand Filby. But the Time\\nTraveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we\\ndistrusted him. Things that would have made the frame of a less\\nclever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things\\ntoo easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt\\nquite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting\\ntheir reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a\\nnursery with egg-shell china. So I don\\'t think any of us said very\\nmuch about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and\\nthe next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of\\nour minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness,\\nthe curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it\\nsuggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the\\ntrick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man,\\nwhom I met on Friday at the Linnaean. He said he had seen a similar\\nthing at Tubingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing out\\nof the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain.\\n\\nThe next Thursday I went again to Richmond--I suppose I was one of\\nthe Time Traveller\\'s most constant guests--and, arriving late, found\\nfour or five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical\\nMan was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand\\nand his watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller,\\nand--\\'It\\'s half-past seven now,\\' said the Medical Man. \\'I suppose\\nwe\\'d better have dinner?\\'\\n\\n\\'Where\\'s----?\\' said I, naming our host.\\n\\n\\'You\\'ve just come? It\\'s rather odd. He\\'s unavoidably detained. He\\nasks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he\\'s not\\nback. Says he\\'ll explain when he comes.\\'\\n\\n\\'It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,\\' said the Editor of a\\nwell-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.\\n\\nThe Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself\\nwho had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the\\nEditor aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another--a quiet,\\nshy man with a beard--whom I didn\\'t know, and who, as far as my\\nobservation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was\\nsome speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller\\'s\\nabsence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit.\\nThe Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist\\nvolunteered a wooden account of the \\'ingenious paradox and trick\\' we\\nhad witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition\\nwhen the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I\\nwas facing the door, and saw it first. \\'Hallo!\\' I said. \\'At last!\\'\\nAnd the door opened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us.\\nI gave a cry of surprise. \\'Good heavens! man, what\\'s the matter?\\'\\ncried the Medical Man, who saw him next. And the whole tableful\\nturned towards the door.\\n\\nHe was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and\\nsmeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it\\nseemed to me greyer--either with dust and dirt or because its colour\\nhad actually faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown\\ncut on it--a cut half healed; his expression was haggard and drawn,\\nas by intense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway,\\nas if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room.\\nHe walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps.\\nWe stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak.\\n\\nHe said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a\\nmotion towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and\\npushed it towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good:\\nfor he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old smile\\nflickered across his face. \\'What on earth have you been up to, man?\\'\\nsaid the Doctor. The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. \\'Don\\'t let\\nme disturb you,\\' he said, with a certain faltering articulation.\\n\\'I\\'m all right.\\' He stopped, held out his glass for more, and took\\nit off at a draught. \\'That\\'s good,\\' he said. His eyes grew brighter,\\nand a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance flickered over\\nour faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warm\\nand comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were feeling\\nhis way among his words. \\'I\\'m going to wash and dress, and then I\\'ll\\ncome down and explain things ... Save me some of that mutton. I\\'m\\nstarving for a bit of meat.\\'\\n\\nHe looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he\\nwas all right. The Editor began a question. \\'Tell you presently,\\'\\nsaid the Time Traveller. \\'I\\'m--funny! Be all right in a minute.\\'\\n\\nHe put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again\\nI remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall,\\nand standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had\\nnothing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the\\ndoor closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered\\nhow he detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my\\nmind was wool-gathering. Then, \\'Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent\\nScientist,\\' I heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in\\nheadlines. And this brought my attention back to the bright\\ndinner-table.\\n\\n\\'What\\'s the game?\\' said the Journalist. \\'Has he been doing the\\nAmateur Cadger? I don\\'t follow.\\' I met the eye of the Psychologist,\\nand read my own interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time\\nTraveller limping painfully upstairs. I don\\'t think any one else had\\nnoticed his lameness.\\n\\nThe first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical\\nMan, who rang the bell--the Time Traveller hated to have servants\\nwaiting at dinner--for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his\\nknife and fork with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The\\ndinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little while,\\nwith gaps of wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his\\ncuriosity. \\'Does our friend eke out his modest income with a\\ncrossing? or has he his Nebuchadnezzar phases?\\' he inquired. \\'I feel\\nassured it\\'s this business of the Time Machine,\\' I said, and took up\\nthe Psychologist\\'s account of our previous meeting. The new guests\\nwere frankly incredulous. The Editor raised objections. \\'What _was_\\nthis time travelling? A man couldn\\'t cover himself with dust by\\nrolling in a paradox, could he?\\' And then, as the idea came home to\\nhim, he resorted to caricature. Hadn\\'t they any clothes-brushes in\\nthe Future? The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, and\\njoined the Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole\\nthing. They were both the new kind of journalist--very joyous,\\nirreverent young men. \\'Our Special Correspondent in the Day\\nafter To-morrow reports,\\' the Journalist was saying--or rather\\nshouting--when the Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in\\nordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained\\nof the change that had startled me.\\n\\n\\'I say,\\' said the Editor hilariously, \\'these chaps here say you have\\nbeen travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about\\nlittle Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?\\'\\n\\nThe Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a\\nword. He smiled quietly, in his old way. \\'Where\\'s my mutton?\\' he\\nsaid. \\'What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!\\'\\n\\n\\'Story!\\' cried the Editor.\\n\\n\\'Story be damned!\\' said the Time Traveller. \\'I want something to\\neat. I won\\'t say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries.\\nThanks. And the salt.\\'\\n\\n\\'One word,\\' said I. \\'Have you been time travelling?\\'\\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his\\nhead.\\n\\n\\'I\\'d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,\\' said the Editor.\\nThe Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang\\nit with his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been\\nstaring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine.\\nThe rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden\\nquestions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the same\\nwith the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by\\ntelling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Traveller devoted his\\nattention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp.\\nThe Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time Traveller\\nthrough his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than\\nusual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of\\nsheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate away,\\nand looked round us. \\'I suppose I must apologize,\\' he said. \\'I was\\nsimply starving. I\\'ve had a most amazing time.\\' He reached out his\\nhand for a cigar, and cut the end. \\'But come into the smoking-room.\\nIt\\'s too long a story to tell over greasy plates.\\' And ringing the\\nbell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining room.\\n\\n\\'You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?\\' he\\nsaid to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new\\nguests.\\n\\n\\'But the thing\\'s a mere paradox,\\' said the Editor.\\n\\n\\'I can\\'t argue to-night. I don\\'t mind telling you the story, but\\nI can\\'t argue. I will,\\' he went on, \\'tell you the story of what\\nhas happened to me, if you like, but you must refrain from\\ninterruptions. I want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like\\nlying. So be it! It\\'s true--every word of it, all the same. I was in\\nmy laboratory at four o\\'clock, and since then ... I\\'ve lived eight\\ndays ... such days as no human being ever lived before! I\\'m nearly\\nworn out, but I shan\\'t sleep till I\\'ve told this thing over to you.\\nThen I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it agreed?\\'\\n\\n\\'Agreed,\\' said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed \\'Agreed.\\' And\\nwith that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth.\\nHe sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man.\\nAfterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only\\ntoo much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink--and, above all, my\\nown inadequacy--to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,\\nattentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker\\'s white,\\nsincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the\\nintonation of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed\\nthe turns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the\\ncandles in the smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face\\nof the Journalist and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees\\ndownward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each\\nother. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the\\nTime Traveller\\'s face.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\n\\'I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time\\nMachine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the\\nworkshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of\\nthe ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of\\nit\\'s sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday, but on Friday,\\nwhen the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the\\nnickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get\\nremade; so that the thing was not complete until this morning. It\\nwas at ten o\\'clock to-day that the first of all Time Machines began\\nits career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put\\none more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the\\nsaddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels\\nmuch the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took\\nthe starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other,\\npressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to\\nreel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round,\\nI saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For\\na moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted\\nthe clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute\\nor so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three!\\n\\n\\'I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both\\nhands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went\\ndark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing\\nme, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to\\ntraverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room\\nlike a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The\\nnight came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment\\ncame to-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter\\nand ever fainter. To-morrow night came black, then day again, night\\nagain, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled\\nmy ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.\\n\\n\\'I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time\\ntravelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling\\nexactly like that one has upon a switchback--of a helpless headlong\\nmotion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent\\nsmash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a\\nblack wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to\\nfall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky,\\nleaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed\\nthe laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the open air.\\nI had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too\\nfast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that\\never crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of\\ndarkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the\\nintermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her\\nquarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling\\nstars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the\\npalpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness;\\nthe sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous\\ncolor like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak\\nof fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating\\nband; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a\\nbrighter circle flickering in the blue.\\n\\n\\'The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hill-side\\nupon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me\\ngrey and dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour,\\nnow brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away.\\nI saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams.\\nThe whole surface of the earth seemed changed--melting and flowing\\nunder my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that registered my\\nspeed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun\\nbelt swayed up and down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or\\nless, and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and\\nminute by minute the white snow flashed across the world, and\\nvanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring.\\n\\n\\'The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They\\nmerged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked\\nindeed a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to\\naccount. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a\\nkind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At\\nfirst I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but\\nthese new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions\\ngrew up in my mind--a certain curiosity and therewith a certain\\ndread--until at last they took complete possession of me. What\\nstrange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our\\nrudimentary civilization, I thought, might not appear when I came to\\nlook nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated\\nbefore my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising about\\nme, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it\\nseemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the\\nhill-side, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even\\nthrough the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. And so\\nmy mind came round to the business of stopping.\\n\\n\\'The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some\\nsubstance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long\\nas I travelled at a high velocity through time, this scarcely\\nmattered; I was, so to speak, attenuated--was slipping like a vapour\\nthrough the interstices of intervening substances! But to come to\\na stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into\\nwhatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimate\\ncontact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical\\nreaction--possibly a far-reaching explosion--would result, and blow\\nmyself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions--into the\\nUnknown. This possibility had occurred to me again and again while I\\nwas making the machine; but then I had cheerfully accepted it as an\\nunavoidable risk--one of the risks a man has got to take! Now the\\nrisk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light.\\nThe fact is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything,\\nthe sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the\\nfeeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerve. I told\\nmyself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I\\nresolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over\\nthe lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was\\nflung headlong through the air.\\n\\n\\'There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have\\nbeen stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me,\\nand I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine.\\nEverything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the\\nconfusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me. I was on what\\nseemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron\\nbushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were\\ndropping in a shower under the beating of the hail-stones. The\\nrebounding, dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine, and drove\\nalong the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin.\\n\"Fine hospitality,\" said I, \"to a man who has travelled innumerable\\nyears to see you.\"\\n\\n\\'Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and\\nlooked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white\\nstone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy\\ndownpour. But all else of the world was invisible.\\n\\n\\'My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail\\ngrew thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very\\nlarge, for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white\\nmarble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings,\\ninstead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so\\nthat it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of\\nbronze, and was thick with verdigris. It chanced that the face was\\ntowards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the\\nfaint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn,\\nand that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood\\nlooking at it for a little space--half a minute, perhaps, or half an\\nhour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it\\ndenser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment and\\nsaw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was\\nlightening with the promise of the sun.\\n\\n\\'I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full\\ntemerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when\\nthat hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have\\nhappened to men? What if cruelty had grown into a common passion?\\nWhat if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had\\ndeveloped into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly\\npowerful? I might seem some old-world savage animal, only the more\\ndreadful and disgusting for our common likeness--a foul creature to\\nbe incontinently slain.\\n\\n\\'Already I saw other vast shapes--huge buildings with intricate\\nparapets and tall columns, with a wooded hill-side dimly creeping\\nin upon me through the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic\\nfear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to\\nreadjust it. As I did so the shafts of the sun smote through the\\nthunderstorm. The grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like\\nthe trailing garments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blue\\nof the summer sky, some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into\\nnothingness. The great buildings about me stood out clear and\\ndistinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out\\nin white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I\\nfelt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in\\nthe clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop. My fear\\ngrew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and again\\ngrappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave under\\nmy desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. One\\nhand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily\\nin attitude to mount again.\\n\\n\\'But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I\\nlooked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote\\nfuture. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer\\nhouse, I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had\\nseen me, and their faces were directed towards me.\\n\\n\\'Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by\\nthe White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of\\nthese emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon\\nwhich I stood with my machine. He was a slight creature--perhaps\\nfour feet high--clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a\\nleather belt. Sandals or buskins--I could not clearly distinguish\\nwhich--were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his\\nhead was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warm\\nthe air was.\\n\\n\\'He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but\\nindescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more\\nbeautiful kind of consumptive--that hectic beauty of which we used\\nto hear so much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence.\\nI took my hands from the machine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\n\\n\\'In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile\\nthing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my\\neyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at\\nonce. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and\\nspoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.\\n\\n\\'There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps\\neight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them\\naddressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was\\ntoo harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my\\nears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then\\ntouched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my\\nback and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was\\nnothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in\\nthese pretty little people that inspired confidence--a graceful\\ngentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so\\nfrail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them\\nabout like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I\\nsaw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily\\nthen, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto\\nforgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the\\nlittle levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my\\npocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of\\ncommunication.\\n\\n\\'And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some\\nfurther peculiarities in their Dresden-china type of prettiness.\\nTheir hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the\\nneck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the\\nface, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small,\\nwith bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a\\npoint. The eyes were large and mild; and--this may seem egotism on\\nmy part--I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the\\ninterest I might have expected in them.\\n\\n\\'As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood\\nround me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I\\nbegan the conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself.\\nThen hesitating for a moment how to express time, I pointed to the\\nsun. At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and\\nwhite followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the\\nsound of thunder.\\n\\n\\'For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was\\nplain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were\\nthese creatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me.\\nYou see I had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight\\nHundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in\\nknowledge, art, everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a\\nquestion that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of\\nour five-year-old children--asked me, in fact, if I had come from\\nthe sun in a thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended\\nupon their clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features.\\nA flow of disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt\\nthat I had built the Time Machine in vain.\\n\\n\\'I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering\\nof a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so\\nand bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of\\nbeautiful flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck.\\nThe idea was received with melodious applause; and presently they\\nwere all running to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging\\nthem upon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. You who\\nhave never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and\\nwonderful flowers countless years of culture had created. Then\\nsomeone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the\\nnearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble,\\nwhich had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my\\nastonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. As I\\nwent with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a\\nprofoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible\\nmerriment, to my mind.\\n\\n\\'The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal\\ndimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of\\nlittle people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me\\nshadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw\\nover their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and\\nflowers, a long neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number\\nof tall spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps\\nacross the spread of the waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if\\nwild, among the variegated shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine\\nthem closely at this time. The Time Machine was left deserted on the\\nturf among the rhododendrons.\\n\\n\\'The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did\\nnot observe the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw\\nsuggestions of old Phoenician decorations as I passed through, and\\nit struck me that they were very badly broken and weather-worn.\\nSeveral more brightly clad people met me in the doorway, and so we\\nentered, I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments, looking\\ngrotesque enough, garlanded with flowers, and surrounded by an\\neddying mass of bright, soft-colored robes and shining white limbs,\\nin a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech.\\n\\n\\'The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with\\nbrown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed\\nwith coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered\\nlight. The floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white\\nmetal, not plates nor slabs--blocks, and it was so much worn, as I\\njudged by the going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply\\nchannelled along the more frequented ways. Transverse to the length\\nwere innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised\\nperhaps a foot from the floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits.\\nSome I recognized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange,\\nbut for the most part they were strange.\\n\\n\\'Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions.\\nUpon these my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do\\nlikewise. With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the\\nfruit with their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into\\nthe round openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to\\nfollow their example, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I\\nsurveyed the hall at my leisure.\\n\\n\\'And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look.\\nThe stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical\\npattern, were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung\\nacross the lower end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that\\nthe corner of the marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless,\\nthe general effect was extremely rich and picturesque. There were,\\nperhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall, and most of\\nthem, seated as near to me as they could come, were watching me with\\ninterest, their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating.\\nAll were clad in the same soft and yet strong, silky material.\\n\\n\\'Fruit, by the by, was all their diet. These people of the remote\\nfuture were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite\\nof some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I\\nfound afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the\\nIchthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful;\\none, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was\\nthere--a floury thing in a three-sided husk--was especially good,\\nand I made it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange\\nfruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to\\nperceive their import.\\n\\n\\'However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future\\nnow. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to\\nmake a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of\\nmine. Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a\\nconvenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began\\na series of interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some\\nconsiderable difficulty in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts\\nmet with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter, but\\npresently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention\\nand repeated a name. They had to chatter and explain the business\\nat great length to each other, and my first attempts to make the\\nexquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount\\nof amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children,\\nand persisted, and presently I had a score of noun substantives at\\nleast at my command; and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and\\neven the verb \"to eat.\" But it was slow work, and the little people\\nsoon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations, so I\\ndetermined, rather of necessity, to let them give their lessons in\\nlittle doses when they felt inclined. And very little doses I found\\nthey were before long, for I never met people more indolent or more\\neasily fatigued.\\n\\n\\'A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was\\ntheir lack of interest. They would come to me with eager cries of\\nastonishment, like children, but like children they would soon stop\\nexamining me and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my\\nconversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that\\nalmost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is\\nodd, too, how speedily I came to disregard these little people. I\\nwent out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as\\nmy hunger was satisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men\\nof the future, who would follow me a little distance, chatter and\\nlaugh about me, and, having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly\\nway, leave me again to my own devices.\\n\\n\\'The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great\\nhall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun.\\nAt first things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely\\ndifferent from the world I had known--even the flowers. The big\\nbuilding I had left was situated on the slope of a broad river\\nvalley, but the Thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present\\nposition. I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a\\nmile and a half away, from which I could get a wider view of this\\nour planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred\\nand One A.D. For that, I should explain, was the date the little\\ndials of my machine recorded.\\n\\n\\'As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly\\nhelp to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I\\nfound the world--for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for\\ninstance, was a great heap of granite, bound together by masses of\\naluminium, a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled\\nheaps, amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like\\nplants--nettles possibly--but wonderfully tinted with brown about\\nthe leaves, and incapable of stinging. It was evidently the derelict\\nremains of some vast structure, to what end built I could not\\ndetermine. It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to have\\na very strange experience--the first intimation of a still stranger\\ndiscovery--but of that I will speak in its proper place.\\n\\n\\'Looking round with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I\\nrested for a while, I realized that there were no small houses to be\\nseen. Apparently the single house, and possibly even the household,\\nhad vanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like\\nbuildings, but the house and the cottage, which form such\\ncharacteristic features of our own English landscape, had\\ndisappeared.\\n\\n\\'\"Communism,\" said I to myself.\\n\\n\\'And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the\\nhalf-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash,\\nI perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft\\nhairless visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem\\nstrange, perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything\\nwas so strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and\\nin all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the\\nsexes from each other, these people of the future were alike. And\\nthe children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their\\nparents. I judged, then, that the children of that time were\\nextremely precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards\\nabundant verification of my opinion.\\n\\n\\'Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I\\nfelt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what\\none would expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a\\nwoman, the institution of the family, and the differentiation of\\noccupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical\\nforce; where population is balanced and abundant, much childbearing\\nbecomes an evil rather than a blessing to the State; where\\nviolence comes but rarely and off-spring are secure, there is less\\nnecessity--indeed there is no necessity--for an efficient family,\\nand the specialization of the sexes with reference to their\\nchildren\\'s needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even\\nin our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I\\nmust remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to\\nappreciate how far it fell short of the reality.\\n\\n\\'While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by\\na pretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in\\na transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then\\nresumed the thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings\\ntowards the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently\\nmiraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a\\nstrange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.\\n\\n\\'There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognize,\\ncorroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered\\nin soft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of\\ngriffins\\' heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of\\nour old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and\\nfair a view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the\\nhorizon and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal\\nbars of purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in\\nwhich the river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already\\nspoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated\\ngreenery, some in ruins and some still occupied. Here and there rose\\na white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth, here and\\nthere came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There\\nwere no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of\\nagriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.\\n\\n\\'So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had\\nseen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation\\nwas something in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a\\nhalf-truth--or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)\\n\\n\\'It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane.\\nThe ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the\\nfirst time I began to realize an odd consequence of the social\\neffort in which we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think,\\nit is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need;\\nsecurity sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the\\nconditions of life--the true civilizing process that makes life more\\nand more secure--had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a\\nunited humanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are\\nnow mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and\\ncarried forward. And the harvest was what I saw!\\n\\n\\'After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of to-day are still\\nin the rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but\\na little department of the field of human disease, but even so,\\nit spreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our\\nagriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and\\ncultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the\\ngreater number to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our\\nfavourite plants and animals--and how few they are--gradually by\\nselective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a seedless\\ngrape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breed\\nof cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideals are vague\\nand tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature,\\ntoo, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all this will\\nbe better organized, and still better. That is the drift of the\\ncurrent in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent,\\neducated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster\\ntowards the subjugation of Nature. In the end, wisely and carefully\\nwe shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit\\nour human needs.\\n\\n\\'This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done\\nindeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine\\nhad leaped. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or\\nfungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers;\\nbrilliant butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of\\npreventive medicine was attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I\\nsaw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay. And I\\nshall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefaction\\nand decay had been profoundly affected by these changes.\\n\\n\\'Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in\\nsplendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them\\nengaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social\\nnor economical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all\\nthat commerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It\\nwas natural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of\\na social paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been\\nmet, I guessed, and population had ceased to increase.\\n\\n\\'But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to\\nthe change. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is\\nthe cause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom:\\nconditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and\\nthe weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the\\nloyal alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and\\ndecision. And the institution of the family, and the emotions that\\narise therein, the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring,\\nparental self-devotion, all found their justification and support in\\nthe imminent dangers of the young. _Now_, where are these imminent\\ndangers? There is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against\\nconnubial jealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion\\nof all sorts; unnecessary things now, and things that make us\\nuncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant\\nlife.\\n\\n\\'I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of\\nintelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my\\nbelief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes\\nQuiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had\\nused all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which\\nit lived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.\\n\\n\\'Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that\\nrestless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness.\\nEven in our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary\\nto survival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and\\nthe love of battle, for instance, are no great help--may even be\\nhindrances--to a civilized man. And in a state of physical balance\\nand security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out\\nof place. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of\\nwar or solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting\\ndisease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil. For\\nsuch a life, what we should call the weak are as well equipped as\\nthe strong, are indeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they\\nare, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there\\nwas no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw\\nwas the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy\\nof mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the\\nconditions under which it lived--the flourish of that triumph which\\nbegan the last great peace. This has ever been the fate of energy in\\nsecurity; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor\\nand decay.\\n\\n\\'Even this artistic impetus would at last die away--had almost died\\nin the Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to\\nsing in the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and\\nno more. Even that would fade in the end into a contented\\ninactivity. We are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and\\nnecessity, and, it seemed to me, that here was that hateful\\ngrindstone broken at last!\\n\\n\\'As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this\\nsimple explanation I had mastered the problem of the world--mastered\\nthe whole secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they\\nhad devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well,\\nand their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary.\\nThat would account for the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my\\nexplanation, and plausible enough--as most wrong theories are!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\n\\'As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the\\nfull moon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver\\nlight in the north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move\\nabout below, a noiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the\\nchill of the night. I determined to descend and find where I could\\nsleep.\\n\\n\\'I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to\\nthe figure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing\\ndistinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see\\nthe silver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron\\nbushes, black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn.\\nI looked at the lawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency.\\n\"No,\" said I stoutly to myself, \"that was not the lawn.\"\\n\\n\\'But it _was_ the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was\\ntowards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came\\nhome to me? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!\\n\\n\\'At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of\\nlosing my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world.\\nThe bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could\\nfeel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing. In another\\nmoment I was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping\\nstrides down the slope. Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost\\nno time in stanching the blood, but jumped up and ran on, with a\\nwarm trickle down my cheek and chin. All the time I ran I was saying\\nto myself: \"They have moved it a little, pushed it under the bushes\\nout of the way.\" Nevertheless, I ran with all my might. All the\\ntime, with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread,\\nI knew that such assurance was folly, knew instinctively that the\\nmachine was removed out of my reach. My breath came with pain. I\\nsuppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the\\nlittle lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young\\nman. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in leaving the\\nmachine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and none\\nanswered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit\\nworld.\\n\\n\\'When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realized. Not a trace\\nof the thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the\\nempty space among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it\\nfuriously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner, and then\\nstopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair. Above me towered\\nthe sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in\\nthe light of the rising moon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my\\ndismay.\\n\\n\\'I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put\\nthe mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of\\ntheir physical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed\\nme: the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose\\nintervention my invention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt\\nassured: unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate,\\nthe machine could not have moved in time. The attachment of the\\nlevers--I will show you the method later--prevented any one from\\ntampering with it in that way when they were removed. It had moved,\\nand was hid, only in space. But then, where could it be?\\n\\n\\'I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running\\nviolently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx,\\nand startling some white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a\\nsmall deer. I remember, too, late that night, beating the bushes\\nwith my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding\\nfrom the broken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of\\nmind, I went down to the great building of stone. The big hall was\\ndark, silent, and deserted. I slipped on the uneven floor, and fell\\nover one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. I lit a\\nmatch and went on past the dusty curtains, of which I have told you.\\n\\n\\'There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon\\nwhich, perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I\\nhave no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming\\nsuddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the\\nsplutter and flare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches.\\n\"Where is my Time Machine?\" I began, bawling like an angry child,\\nlaying hands upon them and shaking them up together. It must have\\nbeen very queer to them. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely\\nfrightened. When I saw them standing round me, it came into my head\\nthat I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do\\nunder the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear.\\nFor, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear\\nmust be forgotten.\\n\\n\\'Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and, knocking one of the people\\nover in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again,\\nout under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little\\nfeet running and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all\\nI did as the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected\\nnature of my loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from\\nmy own kind--a strange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved\\nto and fro, screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory\\nof horrible fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of\\nlooking in this impossible place and that; of groping among moon-lit\\nruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last,\\nof lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute\\nwretchedness. I had nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when\\nI woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping\\nround me on the turf within reach of my arm.\\n\\n\\'I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how\\nI had got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion\\nand despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain,\\nreasonable daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the\\nface. I saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could\\nreason with myself. \"Suppose the worst?\" I said. \"Suppose the\\nmachine altogether lost--perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be\\ncalm and patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear\\nidea of the method of my loss, and the means of getting materials\\nand tools; so that in the end, perhaps, I may make another.\" That\\nwould be my only hope, perhaps, but better than despair. And, after\\nall, it was a beautiful and curious world.\\n\\n\\'But probably, the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must\\nbe calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force\\nor cunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about\\nme, wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and\\ntravel-soiled. The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal\\nfreshness. I had exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about\\nmy business, I found myself wondering at my intense excitement\\novernight. I made a careful examination of the ground about the\\nlittle lawn. I wasted some time in futile questionings, conveyed, as\\nwell as I was able, to such of the little people as came by. They\\nall failed to understand my gestures; some were simply stolid, some\\nthought it was a jest and laughed at me. I had the hardest task in\\nthe world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces. It was\\na foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger\\nwas ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity.\\nThe turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about\\nmidway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet\\nwhere, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine.\\nThere were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow\\nfootprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed\\nmy closer attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said,\\nof bronze. It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep\\nframed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. The\\npedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with care I found them\\ndiscontinuous with the frames. There were no handles or keyholes,\\nbut possibly the panels, if they were doors, as I supposed, opened\\nfrom within. One thing was clear enough to my mind. It took no very\\ngreat mental effort to infer that my Time Machine was inside that\\npedestal. But how it got there was a different problem.\\n\\n\\'I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes\\nand under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned\\nsmiling to them and beckoned them to me. They came, and then,\\npointing to the bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open\\nit. But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I\\ndon\\'t know how to convey their expression to you. Suppose you were\\nto use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman--it is\\nhow she would look. They went off as if they had received the last\\npossible insult. I tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next,\\nwith exactly the same result. Somehow, his manner made me feel\\nashamed of myself. But, as you know, I wanted the Time Machine, and\\nI tried him once more. As he turned off, like the others, my temper\\ngot the better of me. In three strides I was after him, had him by\\nthe loose part of his robe round the neck, and began dragging him\\ntowards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of his\\nface, and all of a sudden I let him go.\\n\\n\\'But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze\\npanels. I thought I heard something stir inside--to be explicit,\\nI thought I heard a sound like a chuckle--but I must have been\\nmistaken. Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came and\\nhammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and the\\nverdigris came off in powdery flakes. The delicate little people\\nmust have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on\\neither hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd of them upon the\\nslopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I sat down\\nto watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too\\nOccidental for a long vigil. I could work at a problem for years,\\nbut to wait inactive for twenty-four hours--that is another matter.\\n\\n\\'I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the\\nbushes towards the hill again. \"Patience,\" said I to myself. \"If you\\nwant your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they\\nmean to take your machine away, it\\'s little good your wrecking their\\nbronze panels, and if they don\\'t, you will get it back as soon as\\nyou can ask for it. To sit among all those unknown things before a\\npuzzle like that is hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this\\nworld. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses\\nat its meaning. In the end you will find clues to it all.\" Then\\nsuddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind: the thought\\nof the years I had spent in study and toil to get into the future\\nage, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it. I had made\\nmyself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a\\nman devised. Although it was at my own expense, I could not help\\nmyself. I laughed aloud.\\n\\n\\'Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little\\npeople avoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had\\nsomething to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt\\ntolerably sure of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no\\nconcern and to abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course\\nof a day or two things got back to the old footing. I made what\\nprogress I could in the language, and in addition I pushed my\\nexplorations here and there. Either I missed some subtle point or\\ntheir language was excessively simple--almost exclusively composed\\nof concrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be few, if any,\\nabstract terms, or little use of figurative language. Their\\nsentences were usually simple and of two words, and I failed to\\nconvey or understand any but the simplest propositions. I determined\\nto put the thought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronze\\ndoors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory,\\nuntil my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural\\nway. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in a\\ncircle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.\\n\\n\\'So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant\\nrichness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the\\nsame abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material\\nand style, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same\\nblossom-laden trees and tree-ferns. Here and there water shone like\\nsilver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and\\nso faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which\\npresently attracted my attention, was the presence of certain\\ncircular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth.\\nOne lay by the path up the hill, which I had followed during my\\nfirst walk. Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze, curiously\\nwrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain. Sitting by\\nthe side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness,\\nI could see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection\\nwith a lighted match. But in all of them I heard a certain sound:\\na thud--thud--thud, like the beating of some big engine; and I\\ndiscovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady current of\\nair set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper into the\\nthroat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was at\\nonce sucked swiftly out of sight.\\n\\n\\'After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers\\nstanding here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was\\noften just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above\\na sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong\\nsuggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose\\ntrue import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to\\nassociate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an\\nobvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong.\\n\\n\\'And here I must admit that I learned very little of drains and\\nbells and modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my\\ntime in this real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and\\ncoming times which I have read, there is a vast amount of detail\\nabout building, and social arrangements, and so forth. But while\\nsuch details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is\\ncontained in one\\'s imagination, they are altogether inaccessible to\\na real traveller amid such realities as I found here. Conceive the\\ntale of London which a negro, fresh from Central Africa, would take\\nback to his tribe! What would he know of railway companies, of\\nsocial movements, of telephone and telegraph wires, of the Parcels\\nDelivery Company, and postal orders and the like? Yet we, at least,\\nshould be willing enough to explain these things to him! And even of\\nwhat he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either\\napprehend or believe? Then, think how narrow the gap between a negro\\nand a white man of our own times, and how wide the interval between\\nmyself and these of the Golden Age! I was sensible of much which was\\nunseen, and which contributed to my comfort; but save for a general\\nimpression of automatic organization, I fear I can convey very\\nlittle of the difference to your mind.\\n\\n\\'In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of\\ncrematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me\\nthat, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere\\nbeyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I\\ndeliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely\\ndefeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make\\na further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm\\namong this people there were none.\\n\\n\\'I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an\\nautomatic civilization and a decadent humanity did not long endure.\\nYet I could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The\\nseveral big palaces I had explored were mere living places, great\\ndining-halls and sleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no\\nappliances of any kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant\\nfabrics that must at times need renewal, and their sandals, though\\nundecorated, were fairly complex specimens of metalwork. Somehow\\nsuch things must be made. And the little people displayed no vestige\\nof a creative tendency. There were no shops, no workshops, no sign\\nof importations among them. They spent all their time in playing\\ngently, in bathing in the river, in making love in a half-playful\\nfashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see how things\\nwere kept going.\\n\\n\\'Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what,\\nhad taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? For\\nthe life of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too,\\nthose flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt--how shall\\nI put it? Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and\\nthere in excellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others\\nmade up of words, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well,\\non the third day of my visit, that was how the world of Eight\\nHundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to\\nme!\\n\\n\\'That day, too, I made a friend--of a sort. It happened that, as I\\nwas watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of\\nthem was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main\\ncurrent ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate\\nswimmer. It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange\\ndeficiency in these creatures, when I tell you that none made the\\nslightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which\\nwas drowning before their eyes. When I realized this, I hurriedly\\nslipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, I\\ncaught the poor mite and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing of\\nthe limbs soon brought her round, and I had the satisfaction of\\nseeing she was all right before I left her. I had got to such a low\\nestimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her.\\nIn that, however, I was wrong.\\n\\n\\'This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little\\nwoman, as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre\\nfrom an exploration, and she received me with cries of delight and\\npresented me with a big garland of flowers--evidently made for me\\nand me alone. The thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had\\nbeen feeling desolate. At any rate I did my best to display my\\nappreciation of the gift. We were soon seated together in a little\\nstone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles. The\\ncreature\\'s friendliness affected me exactly as a child\\'s might have\\ndone. We passed each other flowers, and she kissed my hands. I did\\nthe same to hers. Then I tried talk, and found that her name was\\nWeena, which, though I don\\'t know what it meant, somehow seemed\\nappropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendship\\nwhich lasted a week, and ended--as I will tell you!\\n\\n\\'She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She\\ntried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about\\nit went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last,\\nexhausted and calling after me rather plaintively. But the problems\\nof the world had to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come\\ninto the future to carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress\\nwhen I left her was very great, her expostulations at the parting\\nwere sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as much\\ntrouble as comfort from her devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow,\\na very great comfort. I thought it was mere childish affection that\\nmade her cling to me. Until it was too late, I did not clearly know\\nwhat I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Nor until it was too\\nlate did I clearly understand what she was to me. For, by merely\\nseeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that she\\ncared for me, the little doll of a creature presently gave my return\\nto the neighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling of\\ncoming home; and I would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold\\nso soon as I came over the hill.\\n\\n\\'It was from her, too, that I learned that fear had not yet left the\\nworld. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the\\noddest confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made\\nthreatening grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she\\ndreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness\\nto her was the one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate\\nemotion, and it set me thinking and observing. I discovered then,\\namong other things, that these little people gathered into the great\\nhouses after dark, and slept in droves. To enter upon them without a\\nlight was to put them into a tumult of apprehension. I never found\\none out of doors, or one sleeping alone within doors, after dark.\\nYet I was still such a blockhead that I missed the lesson of that\\nfear, and in spite of Weena\\'s distress I insisted upon sleeping away\\nfrom these slumbering multitudes.\\n\\n\\'It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me\\ntriumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including\\nthe last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm.\\nBut my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been\\nthe night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had\\nbeen restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and\\nthat sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps.\\nI woke with a start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal\\nhad just rushed out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again,\\nbut I felt restless and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour\\nwhen things are just creeping out of darkness, when everything is\\ncolourless and clear cut, and yet unreal. I got up, and went down\\ninto the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in front of the\\npalace. I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the\\nsunrise.\\n\\n\\'The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor\\nof dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky\\nblack, the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless.\\nAnd up the hill I thought I could see ghosts. There several times,\\nas I scanned the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw\\na solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up the\\nhill, and once near the ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some\\ndark body. They moved hastily. I did not see what became of them.\\nIt seemed that they vanished among the bushes. The dawn was still\\nindistinct, you must understand. I was feeling that chill,\\nuncertain, early-morning feeling you may have known. I doubted\\nmy eyes.\\n\\n\\'As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on\\nand its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned\\nthe view keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were\\nmere creatures of the half light. \"They must have been ghosts,\" I\\nsaid; \"I wonder whence they dated.\" For a queer notion of Grant\\nAllen\\'s came into my head, and amused me. If each generation die and\\nleave ghosts, he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with\\nthem. On that theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight\\nHundred Thousand Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four\\nat once. But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these\\nfigures all the morning, until Weena\\'s rescue drove them out of my\\nhead. I associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal\\nI had startled in my first passionate search for the Time Machine.\\nBut Weena was a pleasant substitute. Yet all the same, they were\\nsoon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind.\\n\\n\\'I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather\\nof this Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun\\nwas hotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that\\nthe sun will go on cooling steadily in the future. But people,\\nunfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger Darwin,\\nforget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into\\nthe parent body. As these catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze\\nwith renewed energy; and it may be that some inner planet had\\nsuffered this fate. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the\\nsun was very much hotter than we know it.\\n\\n\\'Well, one very hot morning--my fourth, I think--as I was seeking\\nshelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great\\nhouse where I slept and fed, there happened this strange thing:\\nClambering among these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery,\\nwhose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone.\\nBy contrast with the brilliancy outside, it seemed at first\\nimpenetrably dark to me. I entered it groping, for the change from\\nlight to blackness made spots of colour swim before me. Suddenly I\\nhalted spellbound. A pair of eyes, luminous by reflection against\\nthe daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness.\\n\\n\\'The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched\\nmy hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was\\nafraid to turn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which\\nhumanity appeared to be living came to my mind. And then I\\nremembered that strange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to\\nsome extent, I advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my\\nvoice was harsh and ill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched\\nsomething soft. At once the eyes darted sideways, and something\\nwhite ran past me. I turned with my heart in my mouth, and saw a\\nqueer little ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiar\\nmanner, running across the sunlit space behind me. It blundered\\nagainst a block of granite, staggered aside, and in a moment was\\nhidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry.\\n\\n\\'My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a\\ndull white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there\\nwas flaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it\\nwent too fast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it\\nran on all-fours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an\\ninstant\\'s pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could\\nnot find it at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I\\ncame upon one of those round well-like openings of which I have told\\nyou, half closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me.\\nCould this Thing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and,\\nlooking down, I saw a small, white, moving creature, with large\\nbright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated. It made\\nme shudder. It was so like a human spider! It was clambering down\\nthe wall, and now I saw for the first time a number of metal foot\\nand hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft. Then the\\nlight burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it\\ndropped, and when I had lit another the little monster had\\ndisappeared.\\n\\n\\'I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for\\nsome time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I\\nhad seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that\\nMan had not remained one species, but had differentiated into two\\ndistinct animals: that my graceful children of the Upper-world were\\nnot the sole descendants of our generation, but that this bleached,\\nobscene, nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir\\nto all the ages.\\n\\n\\'I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an\\nunderground ventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And\\nwhat, I wondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly\\nbalanced organization? How was it related to the indolent serenity\\nof the beautiful Upper-worlders? And what was hidden down there,\\nat the foot of that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling\\nmyself that, at any rate, there was nothing to fear, and that there\\nI must descend for the solution of my difficulties. And withal I\\nwas absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two of the beautiful\\nUpper-world people came running in their amorous sport across the\\ndaylight in the shadow. The male pursued the female, flinging\\nflowers at her as he ran.\\n\\n\\'They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned\\npillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form\\nto remark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried\\nto frame a question about it in their tongue, they were still more\\nvisibly distressed and turned away. But they were interested by my\\nmatches, and I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about\\nthe well, and again I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to\\ngo back to Weena, and see what I could get from her. But my mind was\\nalready in revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and\\nsliding to a new adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these\\nwells, to the ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to\\nsay nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the\\nfate of the Time Machine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion\\ntowards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me.\\n\\n\\'Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was\\nsubterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which\\nmade me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome\\nof a long-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was\\nthe bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the\\ndark--the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then,\\nthose large eyes, with that capacity for reflecting light, are\\ncommon features of nocturnal things--witness the owl and the cat.\\nAnd last of all, that evident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty\\nyet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar\\ncarriage of the head while in the light--all reinforced the theory\\nof an extreme sensitiveness of the retina.\\n\\n\\'Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and\\nthese tunnellings were the habitat of the new race. The presence of\\nventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes--everywhere, in\\nfact, except along the river valley--showed how universal were its\\nramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in\\nthis artificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the\\ncomfort of the daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible\\nthat I at once accepted it, and went on to assume the _how_ of this\\nsplitting of the human species. I dare say you will anticipate the\\nshape of my theory; though, for myself, I very soon felt that it\\nfell far short of the truth.\\n\\n\\'At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed\\nclear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present\\nmerely temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and\\nthe Labourer, was the key to the whole position. No doubt it will\\nseem grotesque enough to you--and wildly incredible!--and yet even\\nnow there are existing circumstances to point that way. There is\\na tendency to utilize underground space for the less ornamental\\npurposes of civilization; there is the Metropolitan Railway in\\nLondon, for instance, there are new electric railways, there are\\nsubways, there are underground workrooms and restaurants, and they\\nincrease and multiply. Evidently, I thought, this tendency had\\nincreased till Industry had gradually lost its birthright in the\\nsky. I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever\\nlarger underground factories, spending a still-increasing amount of\\nits time therein, till, in the end--! Even now, does not an East-end\\nworker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut\\noff from the natural surface of the earth?\\n\\n\\'Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people--due, no doubt, to\\nthe increasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf\\nbetween them and the rude violence of the poor--is already leading\\nto the closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the\\nsurface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the\\nprettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this same\\nwidening gulf--which is due to the length and expense of the higher\\neducational process and the increased facilities for and temptations\\ntowards refined habits on the part of the rich--will make that\\nexchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage\\nwhich at present retards the splitting of our species along lines\\nof social stratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end,\\nabove ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfort\\nand beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers getting\\ncontinually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once they\\nwere there, they would no doubt have to pay rent, and not a little\\nof it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused,\\nthey would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of them as were\\nso constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in\\nthe end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as\\nwell adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as happy in\\ntheir way, as the Upper-world people were to theirs. As it seemed to\\nme, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally\\nenough.\\n\\n\\'The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different\\nshape in my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and\\ngeneral co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real\\naristocracy, armed with a perfected science and working to a logical\\nconclusion the industrial system of to-day. Its triumph had not been\\nsimply a triumph over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the\\nfellow-man. This, I must warn you, was my theory at the time. I had\\nno convenient cicerone in the pattern of the Utopian books. My\\nexplanation may be absolutely wrong. I still think it is the\\nmost plausible one. But even on this supposition the balanced\\ncivilization that was at last attained must have long since passed\\nits zenith, and was now far fallen into decay. The too-perfect\\nsecurity of the Upper-worlders had led them to a slow movement of\\ndegeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and\\nintelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had\\nhappened to the Under-grounders I did not yet suspect; but from what\\nI had seen of the Morlocks--that, by the by, was the name by which\\nthese creatures were called--I could imagine that the modification\\nof the human type was even far more profound than among the \"Eloi,\"\\nthe beautiful race that I already knew.\\n\\n\\'Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time\\nMachine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if\\nthe Eloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And\\nwhy were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have\\nsaid, to question Weena about this Under-world, but here again I was\\ndisappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and\\npresently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the\\ntopic was unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little\\nharshly, she burst into tears. They were the only tears, except my\\nown, I ever saw in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased\\nabruptly to trouble about the Morlocks, and was only concerned in\\nbanishing these signs of the human inheritance from Weena\\'s eyes.\\nAnd very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands, while I\\nsolemnly burned a match.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVI\\n\\n\\n\\'It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow\\nup the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt\\na peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the\\nhalf-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in\\nspirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the\\ntouch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic\\ninfluence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began\\nto appreciate.\\n\\n\\'The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a\\nlittle disordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once\\nor twice I had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive\\nno definite reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great\\nhall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight--that\\nnight Weena was among them--and feeling reassured by their presence.\\nIt occurred to me even then, that in the course of a few days the\\nmoon must pass through its last quarter, and the nights grow dark,\\nwhen the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below, these\\nwhitened Lemurs, this new vermin that had replaced the old, might be\\nmore abundant. And on both these days I had the restless feeling of\\none who shirks an inevitable duty. I felt assured that the Time\\nMachine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these\\nunderground mysteries. Yet I could not face the mystery. If only I\\nhad had a companion it would have been different. But I was so\\nhorribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness of the\\nwell appalled me. I don\\'t know if you will understand my feeling,\\nbut I never felt quite safe at my back.\\n\\n\\'It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me\\nfurther and further afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the\\nsouth-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe\\nWood, I observed far off, in the direction of nineteenth-century\\nBanstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any\\nI had hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces\\nor ruins I knew, and the facade had an Oriental look: the face\\nof it having the lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind\\nof bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. This\\ndifference in aspect suggested a difference in use, and I was minded\\nto push on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had come\\nupon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so I\\nresolved to hold over the adventure for the following day, and I\\nreturned to the welcome and the caresses of little Weena. But next\\nmorning I perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the\\nPalace of Green Porcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enable\\nme to shirk, by another day, an experience I dreaded. I resolved I\\nwould make the descent without further waste of time, and started\\nout in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite\\nand aluminium.\\n\\n\\'Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but\\nwhen she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed\\nstrangely disconcerted. \"Good-bye, little Weena,\" I said, kissing\\nher; and then putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet\\nfor the climbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for\\nI feared my courage might leak away! At first she watched me in\\namazement. Then she gave a most piteous cry, and running to me, she\\nbegan to pull at me with her little hands. I think her opposition\\nnerved me rather to proceed. I shook her off, perhaps a little\\nroughly, and in another moment I was in the throat of the well. I\\nsaw her agonized face over the parapet, and smiled to reassure her.\\nThen I had to look down at the unstable hooks to which I clung.\\n\\n\\'I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The\\ndescent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from\\nthe sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of\\na creature much smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily\\ncramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of\\nthe bars bent suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into\\nthe blackness beneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after\\nthat experience I did not dare to rest again. Though my arms and\\nback were presently acutely painful, I went on clambering down the\\nsheer descent with as quick a motion as possible. Glancing upward,\\nI saw the aperture, a small blue disk, in which a star was visible,\\nwhile little Weena\\'s head showed as a round black projection. The\\nthudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive.\\nEverything save that little disk above was profoundly dark, and when\\nI looked up again Weena had disappeared.\\n\\n\\'I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go\\nup the shaft again, and leave the Under-world alone. But even while\\nI turned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with\\nintense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a\\nslender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the\\naperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and\\nrest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I\\nwas trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the\\nunbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air\\nwas full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the\\nshaft.\\n\\n\\'I do not know how long I lay. I was roused by a soft hand touching\\nmy face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and,\\nhastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar\\nto the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating\\nbefore the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me\\nimpenetrable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and\\nsensitive, just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they\\nreflected the light in the same way. I have no doubt they could see\\nme in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any fear\\nof me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match in\\norder to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark\\ngutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the\\nstrangest fashion.\\n\\n\\'I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently\\ndifferent from that of the Over-world people; so that I was needs\\nleft to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before\\nexploration was even then in my mind. But I said to myself, \"You are\\nin for it now,\" and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the\\nnoise of machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from\\nme, and I came to a large open space, and striking another match,\\nsaw that I had entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into\\nutter darkness beyond the range of my light. The view I had of it\\nwas as much as one could see in the burning of a match.\\n\\n\\'Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose\\nout of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim\\nspectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the by,\\nwas very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly\\nshed blood was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a\\nlittle table of white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The\\nMorlocks at any rate were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember\\nwondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red\\njoint I saw. It was all very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big\\nunmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the shadows, and\\nonly waiting for the darkness to come at me again! Then the match\\nburned down, and stung my fingers, and fell, a wriggling red spot\\nin the blackness.\\n\\n\\'I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such\\nan experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had\\nstarted with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would\\ncertainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances.\\nI had come without arms, without medicine, without anything to\\nsmoke--at times I missed tobacco frightfully--even without enough\\nmatches. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that\\nglimpse of the Underworld in a second, and examined it at leisure.\\nBut, as it was, I stood there with only the weapons and the powers\\nthat Nature had endowed me with--hands, feet, and teeth; these, and\\nfour safety-matches that still remained to me.\\n\\n\\'I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the\\ndark, and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered\\nthat my store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me\\nuntil that moment that there was any need to economize them, and I\\nhad wasted almost half the box in astonishing the Upper-worlders, to\\nwhom fire was a novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I\\nstood in the dark, a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling\\nover my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I\\nfancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little\\nbeings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently\\ndisengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The\\nsense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably\\nunpleasant. The sudden realization of my ignorance of their ways of\\nthinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I\\nshouted at them as loudly as I could. They started away, and then\\nI could feel them approaching me again. They clutched at me more\\nboldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I shivered violently,\\nand shouted again--rather discordantly. This time they were not so\\nseriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as they came\\nback at me. I will confess I was horribly frightened. I determined\\nto strike another match and escape under the protection of its\\nglare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper\\nfrom my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But I\\nhad scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the\\nblackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves,\\nand pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me.\\n\\n\\'In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no\\nmistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another\\nlight, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine\\nhow nauseatingly inhuman they looked--those pale, chinless faces\\nand great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!--as they stared in their\\nblindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise\\nyou: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck\\nmy third. It had almost burned through when I reached the opening\\ninto the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for the throb of the great\\npump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projecting\\nhooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and I\\nwas violently tugged backward. I lit my last match ... and it\\nincontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now,\\nand, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the\\nMorlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed\\npeering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who\\nfollowed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy.\\n\\n\\'That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or\\nthirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest\\ndifficulty in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful\\nstruggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I\\nfelt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the\\nwell-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding\\nsunlight. I fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean.\\nThen I remember Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of\\nothers among the Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVII\\n\\n\\n\\'Now, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto,\\nexcept during my night\\'s anguish at the loss of the Time Machine,\\nI had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was\\nstaggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought\\nmyself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people, and\\nby some unknown forces which I had only to understand to overcome;\\nbut there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of\\nthe Morlocks--a something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I\\nloathed them. Before, I had felt as a man might feel who had fallen\\ninto a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it.\\nNow I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy would come upon him\\nsoon.\\n\\n\\'The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the\\nnew moon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first\\nincomprehensible remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now\\nsuch a very difficult problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights\\nmight mean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was a longer\\ninterval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree at\\nleast the reason of the fear of the little Upper-world people for\\nthe dark. I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that\\nthe Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure now that\\nmy second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upper-world people might\\nonce have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their\\nmechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two\\nspecies that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding\\ndown towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new\\nrelationship. The Eloi, like the Carolingian kings, had decayed\\nto a mere beautiful futility. They still possessed the earth on\\nsufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable\\ngenerations, had come at last to find the daylit surface\\nintolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and\\nmaintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the\\nsurvival of an old habit of service. They did it as a standing horse\\npaws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport:\\nbecause ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the\\norganism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed.\\nThe Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago,\\nthousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of\\nthe ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back\\nchanged! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew.\\nThey were becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came\\ninto my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the Under-world.\\nIt seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it\\nwere by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a\\nquestion from outside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had a\\nvague sense of something familiar, but I could not tell what it was\\nat the time.\\n\\n\\'Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their\\nmysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this\\nage of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not\\nparalyse and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend\\nmyself. Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and a\\nfastness where I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could\\nface this strange world with some of that confidence I had lost in\\nrealizing to what creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt\\nI could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them. I\\nshuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined\\nme.\\n\\n\\'I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but\\nfound nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All\\nthe buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous\\nclimbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the\\ntall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished\\ngleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening,\\ntaking Weena like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills\\ntowards the south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or\\neight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen\\nthe place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively\\ndiminished. In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and\\na nail was working through the sole--they were comfortable old shoes\\nI wore about indoors--so that I was lame. And it was already long\\npast sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black\\nagainst the pale yellow of the sky.\\n\\n\\'Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but\\nafter a while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the\\nside of me, occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers\\nto stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at\\nthe last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vase\\nfor floral decoration. At least she utilized them for that purpose.\\nAnd that reminds me! In changing my jacket I found...\\'\\n\\nThe Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and\\nsilently placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white\\nmallows, upon the little table. Then he resumed his narrative.\\n\\n\\'As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over\\nthe hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to\\nreturn to the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant\\npinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to\\nmake her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her\\nFear. You know that great pause that comes upon things before the\\ndusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees. To me there is always an\\nair of expectation about that evening stillness. The sky was clear,\\nremote, and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the\\nsunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my\\nfears. In that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally\\nsharpened. I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of the ground\\nbeneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the Morlocks\\non their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark.\\nIn my excitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of\\ntheir burrows as a declaration of war. And why had they taken my\\nTime Machine?\\n\\n\\'So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night.\\nThe clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another\\ncame out. The ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena\\'s fears and\\nher fatigue grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her\\nand caressed her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her\\narms round my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face\\nagainst my shoulder. So we went down a long slope into a valley, and\\nthere in the dimness I almost walked into a little river. This I\\nwaded, and went up the opposite side of the valley, past a number\\nof sleeping houses, and by a statue--a Faun, or some such figure,\\n_minus_ the head. Here too were acacias. So far I had seen nothing of\\nthe Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and the darker hours\\nbefore the old moon rose were still to come.\\n\\n\\'From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide\\nand black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to\\nit, either to the right or the left. Feeling tired--my feet, in\\nparticular, were very sore--I carefully lowered Weena from my\\nshoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I could no\\nlonger see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my\\ndirection. I looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of\\nwhat it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches one would\\nbe out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other lurking\\ndanger--a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose\\nupon--there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the\\ntree-boles to strike against.\\n\\n\\'I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so I\\ndecided that I would not face it, but would pass the night upon the\\nopen hill.\\n\\n\\'Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her\\nin my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The\\nhill-side was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood\\nthere came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the\\nstars, for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of\\nfriendly comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations\\nhad gone from the sky, however: that slow movement which is\\nimperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had long since\\nrearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, it\\nseemed to me, was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as\\nof yore. Southward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star that\\nwas new to me; it was even more splendid than our own green Sirius.\\nAnd amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet\\nshone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend.\\n\\n\\'Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all\\nthe gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable\\ndistance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of\\nthe unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great\\nprecessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty\\ntimes had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that\\nI had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity,\\nall the traditions, the complex organizations, the nations,\\nlanguages, literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as\\nI knew him, had been swept out of existence. Instead were these\\nfrail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white\\nThings of which I went in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear\\nthat was between the two species, and for the first time, with a\\nsudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen\\nmight be. Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping\\nbeside me, her face white and starlike under the stars, and\\nforthwith dismissed the thought.\\n\\n\\'Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as\\nI could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find\\nsigns of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept\\nvery clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at\\ntimes. Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward\\nsky, like the reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon\\nrose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking\\nit, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then\\ngrowing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had\\nseen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence of renewed\\nday it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable. I\\nstood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle\\nand painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took off my shoes,\\nand flung them away.\\n\\n\\'I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and\\npleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit\\nwherewith to break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones,\\nlaughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such\\nthing in nature as the night. And then I thought once more of the\\nmeat that I had seen. I felt assured now of what it was, and from\\nthe bottom of my heart I pitied this last feeble rill from the great\\nflood of humanity. Clearly, at some time in the Long-Ago of human\\ndecay the Morlocks\\' food had run short. Possibly they had lived on\\nrats and such-like vermin. Even now man is far less discriminating\\nand exclusive in his food than he was--far less than any monkey. His\\nprejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct. And so\\nthese inhuman sons of men----! I tried to look at the thing in a\\nscientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more remote\\nthan our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago.\\nAnd the intelligence that would have made this state of things a\\ntorment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These Eloi were mere\\nfatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed\\nupon--probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena dancing\\nat my side!\\n\\n\\'Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming\\nupon me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human\\nselfishness. Man had been content to live in ease and delight upon\\nthe labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword\\nand excuse, and in the fullness of time Necessity had come home to\\nhim. I even tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy\\nin decay. But this attitude of mind was impossible. However great\\ntheir intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the\\nhuman form not to claim my sympathy, and to make me perforce a\\nsharer in their degradation and their Fear.\\n\\n\\'I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should\\npursue. My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to\\nmake myself such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That\\nnecessity was immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some\\nmeans of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand,\\nfor nothing, I knew, would be more efficient against these Morlocks.\\nThen I wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of\\nbronze under the White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had\\na persuasion that if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of\\nlight before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape. I\\ncould not imagine the Morlocks were strong enough to move it far\\naway. Weena I had resolved to bring with me to our own time. And\\nturning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards the\\nbuilding which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIII\\n\\n\\n\\'I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about\\nnoon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass\\nremained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had\\nfallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high\\nupon a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I\\nwas surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged\\nWandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then--though\\nI never followed up the thought--of what might have happened, or\\nmight be happening, to the living things in the sea.\\n\\n\\'The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed\\nporcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some\\nunknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might\\nhelp me to interpret this, but I only learned that the bare idea of\\nwriting had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I\\nfancy, more human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so\\nhuman.\\n\\n\\'Within the big valves of the door--which were open and broken--we\\nfound, instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many\\nside windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum.\\nThe tiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable array of\\nmiscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering. Then\\nI perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall,\\nwhat was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognized\\nby the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the\\nfashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper bones lay\\nbeside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had\\ndropped through a leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn\\naway. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a\\nBrontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the\\nside I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away\\nthe thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own\\ntime. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair\\npreservation of some of their contents.\\n\\n\\'Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South\\nKensington! Here, apparently, was the Palaeontological Section,\\nand a very splendid array of fossils it must have been, though the\\ninevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time, and\\nhad, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine\\nhundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if\\nwith extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures. Here and\\nthere I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare\\nfossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds. And the\\ncases had in some instances been bodily removed--by the Morlocks as\\nI judged. The place was very silent. The thick dust deadened our\\nfootsteps. Weena, who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping\\nglass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and very\\nquietly took my hand and stood beside me.\\n\\n\\'And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an\\nintellectual age, that I gave no thought to the possibilities it\\npresented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a\\nlittle from my mind.\\n\\n\\'To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain\\nhad a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palaeontology;\\npossibly historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me,\\nat least in my present circumstances, these would be vastly more\\ninteresting than this spectacle of oldtime geology in decay.\\nExploring, I found another short gallery running transversely to the\\nfirst. This appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of a\\nblock of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder. But I could find\\nno saltpeter; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had\\ndeliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a\\ntrain of thinking. As for the rest of the contents of that gallery,\\nthough on the whole they were the best preserved of all I saw, I had\\nlittle interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on\\ndown a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had\\nentered. Apparently this section had been devoted to natural\\nhistory, but everything had long since passed out of recognition. A\\nfew shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed\\nanimals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit, a\\nbrown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for that,\\nbecause I should have been glad to trace the patent readjustments by\\nwhich the conquest of animated nature had been attained. Then we\\ncame to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly\\nill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the\\nend at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from the\\nceiling--many of them cracked and smashed--which suggested that\\noriginally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in\\nmy element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of\\nbig machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some\\nstill fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for\\nmechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these; the more so as\\nfor the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make\\nonly the vaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if\\nI could solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession of\\npowers that might be of use against the Morlocks.\\n\\n\\'Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she\\nstartled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have\\nnoticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It\\nmay be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum\\nwas built into the side of a hill.--ED.] The end I had come in at\\nwas quite above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As\\nyou went down the length, the ground came up against these windows,\\nuntil at last there was a pit like the \"area\" of a London house\\nbefore each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went\\nslowly along, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent\\nupon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light, until\\nWeena\\'s increasing apprehensions drew my attention. Then I saw that\\nthe gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. I hesitated, and\\nthen, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant\\nand its surface less even. Further away towards the dimness, it\\nappeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints. My\\nsense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that.\\nI felt that I was wasting my time in the academic examination of\\nmachinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the\\nafternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means\\nof making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of the\\ngallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had\\nheard down the well.\\n\\n\\'I took Weena\\'s hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her\\nand turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike\\nthose in a signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this\\nlever in my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly\\nWeena, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged\\nthe strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a\\nminute\\'s strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than\\nsufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I\\nlonged very much to kill a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may\\nthink, to want to go killing one\\'s own descendants! But it was\\nimpossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only my\\ndisinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if I began to\\nslake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer, restrained\\nme from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes I\\nheard.\\n\\n\\'Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that\\ngallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first\\nglance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags.\\nThe brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I\\npresently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books. They had\\nlong since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left\\nthem. But here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic\\nclasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I\\nmight, perhaps, have moralized upon the futility of all ambition.\\nBut as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force was the\\nenormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting\\npaper testified. At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly\\nof the _Philosophical Transactions_ and my own seventeen papers upon\\nphysical optics.\\n\\n\\'Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have\\nbeen a gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little\\nhope of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had\\ncollapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every\\nunbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases,\\nI found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were\\nperfectly good. They were not even damp. I turned to Weena. \"Dance,\"\\nI cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed\\nagainst the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in that derelict\\nmuseum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena\\'s huge\\ndelight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling\\n_The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a\\nmodest _cancan_, in part a step dance, in part a skirt-dance (so far\\nas my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally\\ninventive, as you know.\\n\\n\\'Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped\\nthe wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for\\nme it was a most fortunate thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far\\nunlikelier substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed\\njar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed.\\nI fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass\\naccordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the\\nuniversal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive,\\nperhaps through many thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a\\nsepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil\\nBelemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millions\\nof years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that\\nit was inflammable and burned with a good bright flame--was, in\\nfact, an excellent candle--and I put it in my pocket. I found no\\nexplosives, however, nor any means of breaking down the bronze\\ndoors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had\\nchanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated.\\n\\n\\'I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would\\nrequire a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all\\nthe proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of\\narms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a\\nsword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised\\nbest against the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols,\\nand rifles. The most were masses of rust, but many were of some\\nnew metal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder\\nthere may once have been had rotted into dust. One corner I saw was\\ncharred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the\\nspecimens. In another place was a vast array of idols--Polynesian,\\nMexican, Grecian, Phoenician, every country on earth I should think.\\nAnd here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name upon\\nthe nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularly\\ntook my fancy.\\n\\n\\'As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery\\nafter gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes\\nmere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I\\nsuddenly found myself near the model of a tin-mine, and then by the\\nmerest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite\\ncartridges! I shouted \"Eureka!\" and smashed the case with joy. Then\\ncame a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery,\\nI made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in\\nwaiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came.\\nOf course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from\\ntheir presence. I really believe that had they not been so, I should\\nhave rushed off incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and\\n(as it proved) my chances of finding the Time Machine, all together\\ninto non-existence.\\n\\n\\'It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court\\nwithin the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we\\nrested and refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider\\nour position. Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible\\nhiding-place had still to be found. But that troubled me very little\\nnow. I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of\\nall defences against the Morlocks--I had matches! I had the camphor\\nin my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed. It seemed to me that\\nthe best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open,\\nprotected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of the\\nTime Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my iron mace. But\\nnow, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently towards\\nthose bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them,\\nlargely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never\\nimpressed me as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of\\niron not altogether inadequate for the work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIX\\n\\n\\n\\'We emerged from the palace while the sun was still in part above\\nthe horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the\\nnext morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods\\nthat had stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as\\nfar as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep\\nin the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I\\ngathered any sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms\\nfull of such litter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had\\nanticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I began to suffer from\\nsleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the\\nwood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped,\\nfearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending\\ncalamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me\\nonward. I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and I was\\nfeverish and irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the\\nMorlocks with it.\\n\\n\\'While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim\\nagainst their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was\\nscrub and long grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from\\ntheir insidious approach. The forest, I calculated, was rather\\nless than a mile across. If we could get through it to the bare\\nhill-side, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether safer\\nresting-place; I thought that with my matches and my camphor I could\\ncontrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods. Yet it was\\nevident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should\\nhave to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down.\\nAnd then it came into my head that I would amaze our friends behind\\nby lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of this\\nproceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering\\nour retreat.\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must\\nbe in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun\\'s\\nheat is rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by\\ndewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts.\\nLightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to\\nwidespread fire. Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with\\nthe heat of its fermentation, but this rarely results in flame. In\\nthis decadence, too, the art of fire-making had been forgotten on\\nthe earth. The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were\\nan altogether new and strange thing to Weena.\\n\\n\\'She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have\\ncast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up,\\nand in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the\\nwood. For a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking\\nback presently, I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my\\nheap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a\\ncurved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed\\nat that, and turned again to the dark trees before me. It was very\\nblack, and Weena clung to me convulsively, but there was still, as\\nmy eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for me to\\navoid the stems. Overhead it was simply black, except where a gap of\\nremote blue sky shone down upon us here and there. I struck none of\\nmy matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left arm I carried my\\nlittle one, in my right hand I had my iron bar.\\n\\n\\'For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet,\\nthe faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the\\nthrob of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a\\npattering about me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more\\ndistinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had\\nheard in the Under-world. There were evidently several of the\\nMorlocks, and they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another\\nminute I felt a tug at my coat, then something at my arm. And Weena\\nshivered violently, and became quite still.\\n\\n\\'It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did\\nso, and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the\\ndarkness about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the\\nsame peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands,\\ntoo, were creeping over my coat and back, touching even my neck.\\nThen the match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the\\nwhite backs of the Morlocks in flight amid the trees. I hastily took\\na lump of camphor from my pocket, and prepared to light it as soon\\nas the match should wane. Then I looked at Weena. She was lying\\nclutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face to the ground.\\nWith a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely to\\nbreathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground,\\nand as it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the\\nshadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full of\\nthe stir and murmur of a great company!\\n\\n\\'She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder\\nand rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realization. In\\nmanoeuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about\\nseveral times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction\\nlay my path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the\\nPalace of Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to\\nthink rapidly what to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp\\nwhere we were. I put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy\\nbole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I began\\ncollecting sticks and leaves. Here and there out of the darkness\\nround me the Morlocks\\' eyes shone like carbuncles.\\n\\n\\'The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so,\\ntwo white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away.\\nOne was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I\\nfelt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of\\ndismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece\\nof camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed\\nhow dry was some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival\\non the Time Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So,\\ninstead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began\\nleaping up and dragging down branches. Very soon I had a choking\\nsmoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and could economize my\\ncamphor. Then I turned to where Weena lay beside my iron mace. I\\ntried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I could\\nnot even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.\\n\\n\\'Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have\\nmade me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in\\nthe air. My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I\\nfelt very weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was\\nfull of a slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just\\nto nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had\\ntheir hands upon me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily\\nfelt in my pocket for the match-box, and--it had gone! Then they\\ngripped and closed with me again. In a moment I knew what had\\nhappened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitterness\\nof death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the smell of\\nburning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms,\\nand pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to\\nfeel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in\\na monstrous spider\\'s web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt\\nlittle teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my\\nhand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I struggled\\nup, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short,\\nI thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the\\nsucculent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment\\nI was free.\\n\\n\\'The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard\\nfighting came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I\\ndetermined to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my\\nback to a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was\\nfull of the stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices\\nseemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements\\ngrew faster. Yet none came within reach. I stood glaring at the\\nblackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks were\\nafraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing. The\\ndarkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see the\\nMorlocks about me--three battered at my feet--and then I recognized,\\nwith incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in an\\nincessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the\\nwood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish.\\nAs I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap\\nof starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I\\nunderstood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was\\ngrowing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks\\'\\nflight.\\n\\n\\'Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through\\nthe black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning\\nforest. It was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for\\nWeena, but she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the\\nexplosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little\\ntime for reflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the\\nMorlocks\\' path. It was a close race. Once the flames crept forward\\nso swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had to\\nstrike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open\\nspace, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and\\npast me, and went on straight into the fire!\\n\\n\\'And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of\\nall that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright\\nas day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock\\nor tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was\\nanother arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already\\nwrithing from it, completely encircling the space with a fence of\\nfire. Upon the hill-side were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled\\nby the light and heat, and blundering hither and thither against\\neach other in their bewilderment. At first I did not realize their\\nblindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of\\nfear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more.\\nBut when I had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the\\nhawthorn against the red sky, and heard their moans, I was assured\\nof their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I struck\\nno more of them.\\n\\n\\'Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting\\nloose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one\\ntime the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures\\nwould presently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the\\nfight by killing some of them before this should happen; but the\\nfire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about\\nthe hill among them and avoided them, looking for some trace of\\nWeena. But Weena was gone.\\n\\n\\'At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this\\nstrange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and\\nmaking uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat\\non them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and\\nthrough the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they\\nbelonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three\\nMorlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows\\nof my fists, trembling as I did so.\\n\\n\\'For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare.\\nI bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat\\nthe ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and\\nwandered here and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to\\nrubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw\\nMorlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the\\nflames. But, at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above the\\nstreaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening\\ntree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures,\\ncame the white light of the day.\\n\\n\\'I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was\\nplain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I\\ncannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the\\nawful fate to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was\\nalmost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about\\nme, but I contained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind\\nof island in the forest. From its summit I could now make out\\nthrough a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that\\nI could get my bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the\\nremnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and\\nmoaning, as the day grew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet\\nand limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems, that still\\npulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of the Time\\nMachine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well as\\nlame, and I felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death\\nof little Weena. It seemed an overwhelming calamity. Now, in this\\nold familiar room, it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an\\nactual loss. But that morning it left me absolutely lonely\\nagain--terribly alone. I began to think of this house of mine, of\\nthis fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longing\\nthat was pain.\\n\\n\\'But as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning\\nsky, I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose\\nmatches. The box must have leaked before it was lost.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nX\\n\\n\\n\\'About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of\\nyellow metal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of\\nmy arrival. I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and\\ncould not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Here\\nwas the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same\\nsplendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver river\\nrunning between its fertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful\\npeople moved hither and thither among the trees. Some were bathing\\nin exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and that suddenly gave\\nme a keen stab of pain. And like blots upon the landscape rose the\\ncupolas above the ways to the Under-world. I understood now what all\\nthe beauty of the Over-world people covered. Very pleasant was their\\nday, as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field. Like the\\ncattle, they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs. And\\ntheir end was the same.\\n\\n\\'I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had\\nbeen. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly\\ntowards comfort and ease, a balanced society with security and\\npermanency as its watchword, it had attained its hopes--to come\\nto this at last. Once, life and property must have reached almost\\nabsolute safety. The rich had been assured of his wealth and\\ncomfort, the toiler assured of his life and work. No doubt in that\\nperfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social\\nquestion left unsolved. And a great quiet had followed.\\n\\n\\'It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility\\nis the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal\\nperfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism.\\nNature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are\\nuseless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no\\nneed of change. Only those animals partake of intelligence that have\\nto meet a huge variety of needs and dangers.\\n\\n\\'So, as I see it, the Upper-world man had drifted towards his\\nfeeble prettiness, and the Under-world to mere mechanical industry.\\nBut that perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical\\nperfection--absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, the\\nfeeding of the Under-world, however it was effected, had become\\ndisjointed. Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a\\nfew thousand years, came back again, and she began below. The\\nUnder-world being in contact with machinery, which, however perfect,\\nstill needs some little thought outside habit, had probably retained\\nperforce rather more initiative, if less of every other human\\ncharacter, than the Upper. And when other meat failed them, they\\nturned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden. So I say I saw it\\nin my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven\\nHundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit\\ncould invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and as that I\\ngive it to you.\\n\\n\\'After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and\\nin spite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm\\nsunlight were very pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon\\nmy theorizing passed into dozing. Catching myself at that, I took my\\nown hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and\\nrefreshing sleep.\\n\\n\\'I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being\\ncaught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on\\ndown the hill towards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one\\nhand, and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket.\\n\\n\\'And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal\\nof the sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid\\ndown into grooves.\\n\\n\\'At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.\\n\\n\\'Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner\\nof this was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket.\\nSo here, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the\\nWhite Sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost\\nsorry not to use it.\\n\\n\\'A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal.\\nFor once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks.\\nSuppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the\\nbronze frame and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it\\nhad been carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that\\nthe Morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in\\ntheir dim way to grasp its purpose.\\n\\n\\'Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere\\ntouch of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The\\nbronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang.\\nI was in the dark--trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I\\nchuckled gleefully.\\n\\n\\'I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards\\nme. Very calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on\\nthe levers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one\\nlittle thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light\\nonly on the box.\\n\\n\\'You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were\\nclose upon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at\\nthem with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the\\nmachine. Then came one hand upon me and then another. Then I had\\nsimply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers, and\\nat the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One,\\nindeed, they almost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand,\\nI had to butt in the dark with my head--I could hear the Morlock\\'s\\nskull ring--to recover it. It was a nearer thing than the fight in\\nthe forest, I think, this last scramble.\\n\\n\\'But at last the lever was fitted and pulled over. The clinging\\nhands slipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes.\\nI found myself in the same grey light and tumult I have already\\ndescribed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXI\\n\\n\\n\\'I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes\\nwith time travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the\\nsaddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite\\ntime I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite\\nunheeding how I went, and when I brought myself to look at the dials\\nagain I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dial records\\ndays, and another thousands of days, another millions of days, and\\nanother thousands of millions. Now, instead of reversing the levers,\\nI had pulled them over so as to go forward with them, and when I\\ncame to look at these indicators I found that the thousands hand was\\nsweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch--into\\nfuturity.\\n\\n\\'As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of\\nthings. The palpitating greyness grew darker; then--though I was\\nstill travelling with prodigious velocity--the blinking succession\\nof day and night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace,\\nreturned, and grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much\\nat first. The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower,\\nand so did the passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed\\nto stretch through centuries. At last a steady twilight brooded over\\nthe earth, a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared\\nacross the darkling sky. The band of light that had indicated the\\nsun had long since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set--it\\nsimply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broader and more\\nred. All trace of the moon had vanished. The circling of the stars,\\ngrowing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of\\nlight. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very\\nlarge, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with\\na dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction. At\\none time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again,\\nbut it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by this\\nslowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal\\ndrag was done. The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun,\\neven as in our own time the moon faces the earth. Very cautiously,\\nfor I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to reverse\\nmy motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands until the\\nthousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a\\nmere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of a\\ndesolate beach grew visible.\\n\\n\\'I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round.\\nThe sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black,\\nand out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale\\nwhite stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and\\nsouth-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by\\nthe horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The\\nrocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of\\nlife that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation\\nthat covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It\\nwas the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the\\nlichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual\\ntwilight.\\n\\n\\'The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away\\nto the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the\\nwan sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of\\nwind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a\\ngentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving\\nand living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was\\na thick incrustation of salt--pink under the lurid sky. There was a\\nsense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing\\nvery fast. The sensation reminded me of my only experience of\\nmountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied\\nthan it is now.\\n\\n\\'Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a\\nthing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into\\nthe sky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The\\nsound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself\\nmore firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that,\\nquite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving\\nslowly towards me. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous\\ncrab-like creature. Can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table,\\nwith its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws\\nswaying, its long antennae, like carters\\' whips, waving and feeling,\\nand its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic\\nfront? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses,\\nand a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could see\\nthe many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it\\nmoved.\\n\\n\\'As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt\\na tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to\\nbrush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost\\nimmediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught\\nsomething threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a\\nfrightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna\\nof another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes\\nwere wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with\\nappetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime,\\nwere descending upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and\\nI had placed a month between myself and these monsters. But I was\\nstill on the same beach, and I saw them distinctly now as soon as I\\nstopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there, in the\\nsombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green.\\n\\n\\'I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over\\nthe world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt\\nDead Sea, the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring\\nmonsters, the uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous\\nplants, the thin air that hurts one\\'s lungs: all contributed to an\\nappalling effect. I moved on a hundred years, and there was the same\\nred sun--a little larger, a little duller--the same dying sea, the\\nsame chill air, and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in\\nand out among the green weed and the red rocks. And in the westward\\nsky, I saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon.\\n\\n\\'So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a\\nthousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth\\'s fate,\\nwatching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller\\nin the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At\\nlast, more than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of\\nthe sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling\\nheavens. Then I stopped once more, for the crawling multitude of\\ncrabs had disappeared, and the red beach, save for its livid green\\nliverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with\\nwhite. A bitter cold assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again\\ncame eddying down. To the north-eastward, the glare of snow lay\\nunder the starlight of the sable sky and I could see an undulating\\ncrest of hillocks pinkish white. There were fringes of ice along the\\nsea margin, with drifting masses further out; but the main expanse\\nof that salt ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still\\nunfrozen.\\n\\n\\'I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A\\ncertain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the\\nmachine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green\\nslime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A\\nshallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded\\nfrom the beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about\\nupon this bank, but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I\\njudged that my eye had been deceived, and that the black object was\\nmerely a rock. The stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed\\nto me to twinkle very little.\\n\\n\\'Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun\\nhad changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I\\nsaw this grow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this\\nblackness that was creeping over the day, and then I realized that\\nan eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was\\npassing across the sun\\'s disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be\\nthe moon, but there is much to incline me to believe that what I\\nreally saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to\\nthe earth.\\n\\n\\'The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening\\ngusts from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air\\nincreased in number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and\\nwhisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent?\\nIt would be hard to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of\\nman, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects,\\nthe stir that makes the background of our lives--all that was over.\\nAs the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more abundant,\\ndancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense. At\\nlast, one by one, swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks of\\nthe distant hills vanished into blackness. The breeze rose to a\\nmoaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping\\ntowards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were visible. All\\nelse was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black.\\n\\n\\'A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote\\nto my marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I\\nshivered, and a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow\\nin the sky appeared the edge of the sun. I got off the machine to\\nrecover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return\\njourney. As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing\\nupon the shoal--there was no mistake now that it was a moving\\nthing--against the red water of the sea. It was a round thing, the\\nsize of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentacles\\ntrailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering\\nblood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt I\\nwas fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote\\nand awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nXII\\n\\n\\n\\'So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon\\nthe machine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was\\nresumed, the sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with\\ngreater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and\\nflowed. The hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again\\nthe dim shadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity.\\nThese, too, changed and passed, and others came. Presently, when the\\nmillion dial was at zero, I slackened speed. I began to recognize\\nour own pretty and familiar architecture, the thousands hand ran back\\nto the starting-point, the night and day flapped slower and slower.\\nThen the old walls of the laboratory came round me. Very gently,\\nnow, I slowed the mechanism down.\\n\\n\\'I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told\\nyou that when I set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs.\\nWatchett had walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me,\\nlike a rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when\\nshe traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to\\nbe the exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower\\nend opened, and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost,\\nand disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered.\\nJust before that I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed\\nlike a flash.\\n\\n\\'Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar\\nlaboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got\\noff the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several\\nminutes I trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was\\nmy old workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept\\nthere, and the whole thing have been a dream.\\n\\n\\'And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east\\ncorner of the laboratory. It had come to rest again in the\\nnorth-west, against the wall where you saw it. That gives you the\\nexact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the White\\nSphinx, into which the Morlocks had carried my machine.\\n\\n\\'For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came\\nthrough the passage here, limping, because my heel was still\\npainful, and feeling sorely begrimed. I saw the _Pall Mall Gazette_\\non the table by the door. I found the date was indeed to-day, and\\nlooking at the timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o\\'clock. I\\nheard your voices and the clatter of plates. I hesitated--I felt so\\nsick and weak. Then I sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the\\ndoor on you. You know the rest. I washed, and dined, and now I am\\ntelling you the story.\\n\\n\\'I know,\\' he said, after a pause, \\'that all this will be absolutely\\nincredible to you. To me the one incredible thing is that I am here\\nto-night in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces\\nand telling you these strange adventures.\\'\\n\\nHe looked at the Medical Man. \\'No. I cannot expect you to believe\\nit. Take it as a lie--or a prophecy. Say I dreamed it in the\\nworkshop. Consider I have been speculating upon the destinies of our\\nrace until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my assertion of its\\ntruth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest. And taking\\nit as a story, what do you think of it?\\'\\n\\nHe took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap\\nwith it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary\\nstillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the\\ncarpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller\\'s face, and looked\\nround at his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of\\ncolour swam before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the\\ncontemplation of our host. The Editor was looking hard at the end\\nof his cigar--the sixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The\\nothers, as far as I remember, were motionless.\\n\\nThe Editor stood up with a sigh. \\'What a pity it is you\\'re not\\na writer of stories!\\' he said, putting his hand on the Time\\nTraveller\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n\\'You don\\'t believe it?\\'\\n\\n\\'Well----\\'\\n\\n\\'I thought not.\\'\\n\\nThe Time Traveller turned to us. \\'Where are the matches?\\' he said.\\nHe lit one and spoke over his pipe, puffing. \\'To tell you the truth\\n... I hardly believe it myself.... And yet...\\'\\n\\nHis eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers\\nupon the little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his\\npipe, and I saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his\\nknuckles.\\n\\nThe Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers.\\n\\'The gynaeceum\\'s odd,\\' he said. The Psychologist leant forward to\\nsee, holding out his hand for a specimen.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m hanged if it isn\\'t a quarter to one,\\' said the Journalist.\\n\\'How shall we get home?\\'\\n\\n\\'Plenty of cabs at the station,\\' said the Psychologist.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s a curious thing,\\' said the Medical Man; \\'but I certainly don\\'t\\nknow the natural order of these flowers. May I have them?\\'\\n\\nThe Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: \\'Certainly not.\\'\\n\\n\\'Where did you really get them?\\' said the Medical Man.\\n\\nThe Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who\\nwas trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. \\'They were put\\ninto my pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.\\' He stared\\nround the room. \\'I\\'m damned if it isn\\'t all going. This room and you\\nand the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory. Did I\\never make a Time Machine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all\\nonly a dream? They say life is a dream, a precious poor dream at\\ntimes--but I can\\'t stand another that won\\'t fit. It\\'s madness. And\\nwhere did the dream come from? ... I must look at that machine. If\\nthere is one!\\'\\n\\nHe caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through\\nthe door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering\\nlight of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and\\naskew; a thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering\\nquartz. Solid to the touch--for I put out my hand and felt the rail\\nof it--and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of\\ngrass and moss upon the lower parts, and one rail bent awry.\\n\\nThe Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand\\nalong the damaged rail. \\'It\\'s all right now,\\' he said. \\'The story I\\ntold you was true. I\\'m sorry to have brought you out here in the\\ncold.\\' He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we\\nreturned to the smoking-room.\\n\\nHe came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his\\ncoat. The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain\\nhesitation, told him he was suffering from overwork, at which he\\nlaughed hugely. I remember him standing in the open doorway, bawling\\ngood night.\\n\\nI shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a \\'gaudy lie.\\'\\nFor my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was\\nso fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I\\nlay awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go\\nnext day and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the\\nlaboratory, and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him.\\nThe laboratory, however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the\\nTime Machine and put out my hand and touched the lever. At that the\\nsquat substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the\\nwind. Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer\\nreminiscence of the childish days when I used to be forbidden to\\nmeddle. I came back through the corridor. The Time Traveller met me\\nin the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had a small\\ncamera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed when\\nhe saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. \\'I\\'m frightfully busy,\\'\\nsaid he, \\'with that thing in there.\\'\\n\\n\\'But is it not some hoax?\\' I said. \\'Do you really travel through\\ntime?\\'\\n\\n\\'Really and truly I do.\\' And he looked frankly into my eyes. He\\nhesitated. His eye wandered about the room. \\'I only want half an\\nhour,\\' he said. \\'I know why you came, and it\\'s awfully good of you.\\nThere\\'s some magazines here. If you\\'ll stop to lunch I\\'ll prove you\\nthis time travelling up to the hilt, specimen and all. If you\\'ll\\nforgive my leaving you now?\\'\\n\\nI consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,\\nand he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of\\nthe laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily\\npaper. What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly\\nI was reminded by an advertisement that I had promised to meet\\nRichardson, the publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw\\nthat I could barely save that engagement. I got up and went down the\\npassage to tell the Time Traveller.\\n\\nAs I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation,\\noddly truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air\\nwhirled round me as I opened the door, and from within came the\\nsound of broken glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was\\nnot there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in\\na whirling mass of black and brass for a moment--a figure so\\ntransparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was\\nabsolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes.\\nThe Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the\\nfurther end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had,\\napparently, just been blown in.\\n\\nI felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had\\nhappened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange\\nthing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,\\nand the man-servant appeared.\\n\\nWe looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. \\'Has Mr. ----\\ngone out that way?\\' said I.\\n\\n\\'No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him\\nhere.\\'\\n\\nAt that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I\\nstayed on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second,\\nperhaps still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he\\nwould bring with him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must\\nwait a lifetime. The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And,\\nas everybody knows now, he has never returned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEPILOGUE\\n\\n\\nOne cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he\\nswept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy\\nsavages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the\\nCretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian\\nbrutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now--if I may use the\\nphrase--be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral\\nreef, or beside the lonely saline lakes of the Triassic Age. Or did\\nhe go forward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still\\nmen, but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome\\nproblems solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own\\npart, cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment,\\nfragmentary theory, and mutual discord are indeed man\\'s culminating\\ntime! I say, for my own part. He, I know--for the question had been\\ndiscussed among us long before the Time Machine was made--thought\\nbut cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the\\ngrowing pile of civilization only a foolish heaping that must\\ninevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end. If that\\nis so, it remains for us to live as though it were not so. But to me\\nthe future is still black and blank--is a vast ignorance, lit at a\\nfew casual places by the memory of his story. And I have by me, for\\nmy comfort, two strange white flowers--shrivelled now, and brown and\\nflat and brittle--to witness that even when mind and strength had\\ngone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart\\nof man.\\n'"

His pale grey eyes shone and\\ntwinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire\\nburnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the\\nlilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our\\nglasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather\\nthan submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious\\nafter-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the\\ntrammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the\\npoints with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his\\nearnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.\\n\\n“You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two\\nideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance,\\nthey taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”\\n\\n“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said\\nFilby, an argumentative person with red hair.\\n\\n“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground\\nfor it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of\\ncourse that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_, has no real\\nexistence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane.\\nThese things are mere abstractions.”\\n\\n“That is all right,” said the Psychologist.\\n\\n“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a\\nreal existence.”\\n\\n“There I object,” said Filby. “Of course a solid body may exist. All\\nreal things—”\\n\\n“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_ cube\\nexist?”\\n\\n“Don’t follow you,” said Filby.\\n\\n“Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real\\nexistence?”\\n\\nFilby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any\\nreal body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have\\nLength, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural\\ninfirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we\\nincline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three\\nwhich we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is,\\nhowever, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former\\nthree dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our\\nconsciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter\\nfrom the beginning to the end of our lives.”\\n\\n“That,” said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his\\ncigar over the lamp; “that . . . very clear indeed.”\\n\\n“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,”\\ncontinued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness.\\n“Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some\\npeople who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It\\nis only another way of looking at Time. _There is no difference between\\nTime and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our\\nconsciousness moves along it_. But some foolish people have got hold of\\nthe wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say\\nabout this Fourth Dimension?”\\n\\n“_I_ have not,” said the Provincial Mayor.\\n\\n“It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is\\nspoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,\\nBreadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three\\nplanes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical\\npeople have been asking why _three_ dimensions particularly—why not\\nanother direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even\\ntried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb\\nwas expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month\\nor so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only two\\ndimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and\\nsimilarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could\\nrepresent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the\\nthing. See?”\\n\\n“I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows,\\nhe lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who\\nrepeats mystic words. “Yes, I think I see it now,” he said after some\\ntime, brightening in a quite transitory manner.\\n\\n“Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry\\nof Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For\\ninstance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at\\nfifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All\\nthese are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional\\nrepresentations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and\\nunalterable thing.\\n\\n“Scientific people,” proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause\\nrequired for the proper assimilation of this, “know very well that Time\\nis only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a\\nweather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of\\nthe barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then\\nthis morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the\\nmercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space\\ngenerally recognised? But certainly it traced such a line, and that\\nline, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.”\\n\\n“But,” said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, “if\\nTime is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has\\nit always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move\\nin Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?”\\n\\nThe Time Traveller smiled. “Are you so sure we can move freely in\\nSpace? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,\\nand men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions.\\nBut how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.”\\n\\n“Not exactly,” said the Medical Man. “There are balloons.”\\n\\n“But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the\\ninequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.”\\n\\n“Still they could move a little up and down,” said the Medical Man.\\n\\n“Easier, far easier down than up.”\\n\\n“And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the\\npresent moment.”\\n\\n“My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the\\nwhole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present\\nmoment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no\\ndimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform\\nvelocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_\\nif we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.”\\n\\n“But the great difficulty is this,” interrupted the Psychologist. ’You\\n_can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about\\nin Time.”\\n\\n“That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that\\nwe cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an\\nincident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I\\nbecome absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course\\nwe have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than\\na savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a\\ncivilised man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go\\nup against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that\\nultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the\\nTime-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?”\\n\\n“Oh, _this_,” began Filby, “is all—”\\n\\n“Why not?” said the Time Traveller.\\n\\n“It’s against reason,” said Filby.\\n\\n“What reason?” said the Time Traveller.\\n\\n“You can show black is white by argument,” said Filby, “but you will\\nnever convince me.”\\n\\n“Possibly not,” said the Time Traveller. “But now you begin to see the\\nobject of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long\\nago I had a vague inkling of a machine—”\\n\\n“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Very Young Man.\\n\\n“That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as\\nthe driver determines.”\\n\\nFilby contented himself with laughter.\\n\\n“But I have experimental verification,” said the Time Traveller.\\n\\n“It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,” the Psychologist\\nsuggested. “One might travel back and verify the accepted account of\\nthe Battle of Hastings, for instance!”\\n\\n“Don’t you think you would attract attention?” said the Medical Man.\\n“Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.”\\n\\n“One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,” the\\nVery Young Man thought.\\n\\n“In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The\\nGerman scholars have improved Greek so much.”\\n\\n“Then there is the future,” said the Very Young Man. “Just think! One\\nmight invest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and\\nhurry on ahead!”\\n\\n“To discover a society,” said I, “erected on a strictly communistic\\nbasis.”\\n\\n“Of all the wild extravagant theories!” began the Psychologist.\\n\\n“Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until—”\\n\\n“Experimental verification!” cried I. “You are going to verify _that_?”\\n\\n“The experiment!” cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.\\n\\n“Let’s see your experiment anyhow,” said the Psychologist, “though it’s\\nall humbug, you know.”\\n\\nThe Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and\\nwith his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of\\nthe room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to\\nhis laboratory.\\n\\nThe Psychologist looked at us. “I wonder what he’s got?”\\n\\n“Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,” said the Medical Man, and Filby\\ntried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he\\nhad finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s\\nanecdote collapsed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n II.\\n The Machine\\n\\n\\nThe thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic\\nframework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately\\nmade. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline\\nsubstance. And now I must be explicit, for this that follows—unless his\\nexplanation is to be accepted—is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He\\ntook one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the\\nroom, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug.\\nOn this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat\\ndown. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the\\nbright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a\\ndozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and\\nseveral in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat\\nin a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to\\nbe almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat\\nbehind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the\\nProvincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the\\nPsychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the\\nPsychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me\\nthat any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly\\ndone, could have been played upon us under these conditions.\\n\\nThe Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. “Well?”\\nsaid the Psychologist.\\n\\n“This little affair,” said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon\\nthe table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, “is only\\na model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through time. You will\\nnotice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd\\ntwinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way\\nunreal.” He pointed to the part with his finger. “Also, here is one\\nlittle white lever, and here is another.”\\n\\nThe Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.\\n“It’s beautifully made,” he said.\\n\\n“It took two years to make,” retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when we\\nhad all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: “Now I want\\nyou clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sends\\nthe machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the\\nmotion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently\\nI am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. It will\\nvanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a good look at the\\nthing. Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is no\\ntrickery. I don’t want to waste this model, and then be told I’m a\\nquack.”\\n\\nThere was a minute’s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to\\nspeak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth\\nhis finger towards the lever. “No,” he said suddenly. “Lend me your\\nhand.” And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual’s hand\\nin his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it was the\\nPsychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its\\ninterminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain\\nthere was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame\\njumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little\\nmachine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost\\nfor a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory;\\nand it was gone—vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare.\\n\\nEveryone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.\\n\\nThe Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under\\nthe table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully. “Well?” he\\nsaid, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then, getting up, he\\nwent to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to us began to\\nfill his pipe.\\n\\nWe stared at each other. “Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you in\\nearnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine has\\ntravelled into time?”\\n\\n“Certainly,” said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the\\nfire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologist’s\\nface. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not unhinged, helped\\nhimself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.) “What is more, I have\\na big machine nearly finished in there”—he indicated the\\nlaboratory—“and when that is put together I mean to have a journey on\\nmy own account.”\\n\\n“You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?” said\\nFilby.\\n\\n“Into the future or the past—I don’t, for certain, know which.”\\n\\nAfter an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. “It must have\\ngone into the past if it has gone anywhere,” he said.\\n\\n“Why?” said the Time Traveller.\\n\\n“Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled\\ninto the future it would still be here all this time, since it must\\nhave travelled through this time.”\\n\\n“But,” said I, “If it travelled into the past it would have been\\nvisible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we\\nwere here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!”\\n\\n“Serious objections,” remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of\\nimpartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.\\n\\n“Not a bit,” said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: “You\\nthink. _You_ can explain that. It’s presentation below the threshold,\\nyou know, diluted presentation.”\\n\\n“Of course,” said the Psychologist, and reassured us. “That’s a simple\\npoint of psychology. I should have thought of it. It’s plain enough,\\nand helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we\\nappreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel\\nspinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travelling\\nthrough time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if it\\ngets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression it\\ncreates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it\\nwould make if it were not travelling in time. That’s plain enough.” He\\npassed his hand through the space in which the machine had been. “You\\nsee?” he said, laughing.\\n\\nWe sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the Time\\nTraveller asked us what we thought of it all.\\n\\n“It sounds plausible enough tonight,” said the Medical Man; “but wait\\nuntil tomorrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.”\\n\\n“Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?” asked the Time\\nTraveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way\\ndown the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly\\nthe flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of\\nthe shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how\\nthere in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little\\nmechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of\\nnickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of\\nrock crystal. The thing was generally complete, but the twisted\\ncrystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of\\ndrawings, and I took one up for a better look at it. Quartz it seemed\\nto be.\\n\\n“Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you perfectly serious? Or is\\nthis a trick—like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?”\\n\\n“Upon that machine,” said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft,\\n“I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more serious in\\nmy life.”\\n\\nNone of us quite knew how to take it.\\n\\nI caught Filby’s eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he\\nwinked at me solemnly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n III.\\n The Time Traveller Returns\\n\\n\\nI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time\\nMachine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are\\ntoo clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him;\\nyou always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush,\\nbehind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the\\nmatter in the Time Traveller’s words, we should have shown _him_ far\\nless scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a\\npork-butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more\\nthan a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things\\nthat would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his\\nhands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who\\ntook him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were\\nsomehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was\\nlike furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don’t think any of\\nus said very much about time travelling in the interval between that\\nThursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in\\nmost of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical\\nincredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter\\nconfusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied\\nwith the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the\\nMedical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linnæan. He said he had seen a\\nsimilar thing at Tübingen, and laid considerable stress on the\\nblowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not\\nexplain.\\n\\nThe next Thursday I went again to Richmond—I suppose I was one of the\\nTime Traveller’s most constant guests—and, arriving late, found four or\\nfive men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was\\nstanding before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his\\nwatch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller, and—“It’s\\nhalf-past seven now,” said the Medical Man. “I suppose we’d better have\\ndinner?”\\n\\n“Where’s——?” said I, naming our host.\\n\\n“You’ve just come? It’s rather odd. He’s unavoidably detained. He asks\\nme in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he’s not back. Says\\nhe’ll explain when he comes.”\\n\\n“It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,” said the Editor of a\\nwell-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.\\n\\nThe Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself who\\nhad attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Editor\\naforementioned, a certain journalist, and another—a quiet, shy man with\\na beard—whom I didn’t know, and who, as far as my observation went,\\nnever opened his mouth all the evening. There was some speculation at\\nthe dinner-table about the Time Traveller’s absence, and I suggested\\ntime travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor wanted that\\nexplained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of\\nthe “ingenious paradox and trick” we had witnessed that day week. He\\nwas in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor\\nopened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it\\nfirst. “Hallo!” I said. “At last!” And the door opened wider, and the\\nTime Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. “Good\\nheavens! man, what’s the matter?” cried the Medical Man, who saw him\\nnext. And the whole tableful turned towards the door.\\n\\nHe was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared\\nwith green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to\\nme greyer—either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually\\nfaded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it—a cut\\nhalf-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense\\nsuffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been\\ndazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just\\nsuch a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in\\nsilence, expecting him to speak.\\n\\nHe said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion\\ntowards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it\\ntowards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked\\nround the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his\\nface. “What on earth have you been up to, man?” said the Doctor. The\\nTime Traveller did not seem to hear. “Don’t let me disturb you,” he\\nsaid, with a certain faltering articulation. “I’m all right.” He\\nstopped, held out his glass for more, and took it off at a draught.\\n“That’s good,” he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came\\ninto his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain\\ndull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then\\nhe spoke again, still as it were feeling his way among his words. “I’m\\ngoing to wash and dress, and then I’ll come down and explain things....\\nSave me some of that mutton. I’m starving for a bit of meat.”\\n\\nHe looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he\\nwas all right. The Editor began a question. “Tell you presently,” said\\nthe Time Traveller. “I’m—funny! Be all right in a minute.”\\n\\nHe put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I\\nremarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and\\nstanding up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing\\non them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the door\\nclosed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he\\ndetested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was\\nwool-gathering. Then, “Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,” I\\nheard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this\\nbrought my attention back to the bright dinner-table.\\n\\n“What’s the game?” said the Journalist. “Has he been doing the Amateur\\nCadger? I don’t follow.” I met the eye of the Psychologist, and read my\\nown interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time Traveller limping\\npainfully upstairs. I don’t think anyone else had noticed his lameness.\\n\\nThe first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man,\\nwho rang the bell—the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting at\\ndinner—for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his knife and fork\\nwith a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The dinner was resumed.\\nConversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of\\nwonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity. “Does our\\nfriend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he his\\nNebuchadnezzar phases?” he inquired. “I feel assured it’s this business\\nof the Time Machine,” I said, and took up the Psychologist’s account of\\nour previous meeting. The new guests were frankly incredulous. The\\nEditor raised objections. “What _was_ this time travelling? A man\\ncouldn’t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?”\\nAnd then, as the idea came home to him, he resorted to caricature.\\nHadn’t they any clothes-brushes in the Future? The Journalist too,\\nwould not believe at any price, and joined the Editor in the easy work\\nof heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kind of\\njournalist—very joyous, irreverent young men. “Our Special\\nCorrespondent in the Day after Tomorrow reports,” the Journalist was\\nsaying—or rather shouting—when the Time Traveller came back. He was\\ndressed in ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look\\nremained of the change that had startled me.\\n\\n“I say,” said the Editor hilariously, “these chaps here say you have\\nbeen travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about little\\nRosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?”\\n\\nThe Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word.\\nHe smiled quietly, in his old way. “Where’s my mutton?” he said. “What\\na treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!”\\n\\n“Story!” cried the Editor.\\n\\n“Story be damned!” said the Time Traveller. “I want something to eat. I\\nwon’t say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And\\nthe salt.”\\n\\n“One word,” said I. “Have you been time travelling?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head.\\n\\n“I’d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,” said the Editor. The\\nTime Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with\\nhis fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring at his\\nface, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the dinner\\nwas uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising to\\nmy lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalist\\ntried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The\\nTime Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the\\nappetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched\\nthe Time Traveller through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even\\nmore clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and\\ndetermination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller\\npushed his plate away, and looked round us. “I suppose I must\\napologise,” he said. “I was simply starving. I’ve had a most amazing\\ntime.” He reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. “But come\\ninto the smoking-room. It’s too long a story to tell over greasy\\nplates.” And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the\\nadjoining room.\\n\\n“You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?” he said\\nto me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests.\\n\\n“But the thing’s a mere paradox,” said the Editor.\\n\\n“I can’t argue tonight. I don’t mind telling you the story, but I can’t\\nargue. I will,” he went on, “tell you the story of what has happened to\\nme, if you like, but you must refrain from interruptions. I want to\\ntell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like lying. So be it! It’s\\ntrue—every word of it, all the same. I was in my laboratory at four\\no’clock, and since then … I’ve lived eight days … such days as no human\\nbeing ever lived before! I’m nearly worn out, but I shan’t sleep till\\nI’ve told this thing over to you. Then I shall go to bed. But no\\ninterruptions! Is it agreed?”\\n\\n“Agreed,” said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed “Agreed.” And with\\nthat the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth. He sat\\nback in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man. Afterwards he\\ngot more animated. In writing it down I feel with only too much\\nkeenness the inadequacy of pen and ink—and, above all, my own\\ninadequacy—to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,\\nattentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker’s white, sincere\\nface in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the intonation\\nof his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed the turns of\\nhis story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in the\\nsmoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face of the Journalist\\nand the legs of the Silent Man from the knees downward were\\nilluminated. At first we glanced now and again at each other. After a\\ntime we ceased to do that, and looked only at the Time Traveller’s\\nface.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n IV.\\n Time Travelling\\n\\n\\n“I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time\\nMachine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the\\nworkshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the\\nivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it’s\\nsound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when\\nthe putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel\\nbars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; so\\nthat the thing was not complete until this morning. It was at ten\\no’clock today that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I\\ngave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of\\noil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a\\nsuicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at\\nwhat will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever in one\\nhand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost\\nimmediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation\\nof falling; and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before.\\nHad anything happened? For a moment I suspected that my intellect had\\ntricked me. Then I noted the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it\\nhad stood at a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past\\nthree!\\n\\n“I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both\\nhands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark.\\nMrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards\\nthe garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the\\nplace, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I\\npressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the\\nturning out of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. The\\nlaboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. Tomorrow\\nnight came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and\\nfaster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb\\nconfusedness descended on my mind.\\n\\n“I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time\\ntravelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly\\nlike that one has upon a switchback—of a helpless headlong motion! I\\nfelt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I\\nput on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The\\ndim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me,\\nand I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every\\nminute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had\\nbeen destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression\\nof scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any\\nmoving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast\\nfor me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively\\npainful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the\\nmoon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a\\nfaint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, still\\ngaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one\\ncontinuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a\\nsplendid luminous colour like that of early twilight; the jerking sun\\nbecame a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter\\nfluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and\\nthen a brighter circle flickering in the blue.\\n\\n“The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hillside upon\\nwhich this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and\\ndim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown,\\nnow green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw huge\\nbuildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The whole\\nsurface of the earth seemed changed—melting and flowing under my eyes.\\nThe little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round\\nfaster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and\\ndown, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that\\nconsequently my pace was over a year a minute; and minute by minute the\\nwhite snow flashed across the world, and vanished, and was followed by\\nthe bright, brief green of spring.\\n\\n“The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They\\nmerged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked,\\nindeed, a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to\\naccount. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind\\nof madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first I\\nscarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new\\nsensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my\\nmind—a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread—until at last\\nthey took complete possession of me. What strange developments of\\nhumanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation, I\\nthought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dim\\nelusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and\\nsplendid architecture rising about me, more massive than any buildings\\nof our own time, and yet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I\\nsaw a richer green flow up the hillside, and remain there, without any\\nwintry intermission. Even through the veil of my confusion the earth\\nseemed very fair. And so my mind came round to the business of\\nstopping.\\n\\n“The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance\\nin the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelled\\nat a high velocity through time, this scarcely mattered: I was, so to\\nspeak, attenuated—was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of\\nintervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of\\nmyself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant\\nbringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle\\nthat a profound chemical reaction—possibly a far-reaching\\nexplosion—would result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of all\\npossible dimensions—into the Unknown. This possibility had occurred to\\nme again and again while I was making the machine; but then I had\\ncheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk—one of the risks a man\\nhas got to take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the\\nsame cheerful light. The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute\\nstrangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the\\nmachine, above all, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely\\nupset my nerves. I told myself that I could never stop, and with a gust\\nof petulance I resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I\\nlugged over the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over,\\nand I was flung headlong through the air.\\n\\n“There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been\\nstunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was\\nsitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine. Everything still\\nseemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was\\ngone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a\\ngarden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their\\nmauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating\\nof the hailstones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a little cloud\\nover the machine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a moment I\\nwas wet to the skin. ‘Fine hospitality,’ said I, ‘to a man who has\\ntravelled innumerable years to see you.’\\n\\n“Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and\\nlooked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white\\nstone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy\\ndownpour. But all else of the world was invisible.\\n\\n“My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew\\nthinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, for\\na silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in\\nshape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being\\ncarried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to\\nhover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick\\nwith verdigris. It chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless\\neyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the\\nlips. It was greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasant\\nsuggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for a little space—half a\\nminute, perhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as\\nthe hail drove before it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from\\nit for a moment, and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and\\nthat the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun.\\n\\n“I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerity\\nof my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when that hazy\\ncurtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have happened to men?\\nWhat if cruelty had grown into a common passion? What if in this\\ninterval the race had lost its manliness, and had developed into\\nsomething inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I might\\nseem some old-world savage animal, only the more dreadful and\\ndisgusting for our common likeness—a foul creature to be incontinently\\nslain.\\n\\n“Already I saw other vast shapes—huge buildings with intricate parapets\\nand tall columns, with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon me\\nthrough the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic fear. I turned\\nfrantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to readjust it. As I\\ndid so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm. The grey\\ndownpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a\\nghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faint\\nbrown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildings\\nabout me stood out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the\\nthunderstorm, and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled\\nalong their courses. I felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps\\na bird may feel in the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will\\nswoop. My fear grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth,\\nand again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave\\nunder my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently.\\nOne hand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily\\nin attitude to mount again.\\n\\n“But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I\\nlooked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote\\nfuture. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer house,\\nI saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had seen me, and\\ntheir faces were directed towards me.\\n\\n“Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by the\\nWhite Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of these\\nemerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which I\\nstood with my machine. He was a slight creature—perhaps four feet\\nhigh—clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather belt.\\nSandals or buskins—I could not clearly distinguish which—were on his\\nfeet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head was bare. Noticing\\nthat, I noticed for the first time how warm the air was.\\n\\n“He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but\\nindescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful\\nkind of consumptive—that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so\\nmuch. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence. I took my\\nhands from the machine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n V.\\n In the Golden Age\\n\\n\\n“In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile\\nthing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my\\neyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at\\nonce. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke\\nto them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.\\n\\n“There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps\\neight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them\\naddressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too\\nharsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears,\\nshook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my\\nhand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and\\nshoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in\\nthis at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty\\nlittle people that inspired confidence—a graceful gentleness, a certain\\nchildlike ease. And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy\\nmyself flinging the whole dozen of them about like ninepins. But I made\\na sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling\\nat the Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought\\nof a danger I had hitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the\\nmachine I unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion, and\\nput these in my pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in\\nthe way of communication.\\n\\n“And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further\\npeculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their hair,\\nwhich was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek;\\nthere was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears\\nwere singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather\\nthin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and\\nmild; and—this may seem egotism on my part—I fancied even that there\\nwas a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them.\\n\\n“As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round\\nme smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the\\nconversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then,\\nhesitating for a moment how to express Time, I pointed to the sun. At\\nonce a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white\\nfollowed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the sound of\\nthunder.\\n\\n“For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was\\nplain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were these\\ncreatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me. You see, I\\nhad always anticipated that the people of the year Eight Hundred and\\nTwo Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, art,\\neverything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed\\nhim to be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old\\nchildren—asked me, in fact, if I had come from the sun in a\\nthunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended upon their\\nclothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features. A flow of\\ndisappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt that I had\\nbuilt the Time Machine in vain.\\n\\n“I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering of\\na thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so and\\nbowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful\\nflowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck. The idea was\\nreceived with melodious applause; and presently they were all running\\nto and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging them upon me until I\\nwas almost smothered with blossom. You who have never seen the like can\\nscarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of\\nculture had created. Then someone suggested that their plaything should\\nbe exhibited in the nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx\\nof white marble, which had seemed to watch me all the while with a\\nsmile at my astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone.\\nAs I went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a\\nprofoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible\\nmerriment, to my mind.\\n\\n“The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal\\ndimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of\\nlittle people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me\\nshadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw over\\ntheir heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a long\\nneglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number of tall spikes of\\nstrange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of\\nthe waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if wild, among the variegated\\nshrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine them closely at this time. The\\nTime Machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons.\\n\\n“The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not\\nobserve the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions\\nof old Phœnician decorations as I passed through, and it struck me that\\nthey were very badly broken and weather-worn. Several more brightly\\nclad people met me in the doorway, and so we entered, I, dressed in\\ndingy nineteenth-century garments, looking grotesque enough, garlanded\\nwith flowers, and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright,\\nsoft-coloured robes and shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl of\\nlaughter and laughing speech.\\n\\n“The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with\\nbrown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with\\ncoloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The\\nfloor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal, not\\nplates nor slabs—blocks, and it was so much worn, as I judged by the\\ngoing to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply channelled along\\nthe more frequented ways. Transverse to the length were innumerable\\ntables made of slabs of polished stone, raised, perhaps, a foot from\\nthe floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits. Some I recognised as a\\nkind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange, but for the most part they\\nwere strange.\\n\\n“Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. Upon\\nthese my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do likewise.\\nWith a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with\\ntheir hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into the round\\nopenings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to follow their\\nexample, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I surveyed the hall\\nat my leisure.\\n\\n“And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look.\\nThe stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical pattern,\\nwere broken in many places, and the curtains that hung across the lower\\nend were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that the corner of the\\nmarble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless, the general effect\\nwas extremely rich and picturesque. There were, perhaps, a couple of\\nhundred people dining in the hall, and most of them, seated as near to\\nme as they could come, were watching me with interest, their little\\neyes shining over the fruit they were eating. All were clad in the same\\nsoft, and yet strong, silky material.\\n\\n“Fruit, by the bye, was all their diet. These people of the remote\\nfuture were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite of\\nsome carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I found\\nafterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the\\nIchthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful;\\none, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was\\nthere—a floury thing in a three-sided husk—was especially good, and I\\nmade it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange fruits,\\nand by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to perceive their\\nimport.\\n\\n“However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future\\nnow. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to make\\na resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine.\\nClearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a convenient\\nthing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began a series of\\ninterrogative sounds and gestures. I had some considerable difficulty\\nin conveying my meaning. At first my efforts met with a stare of\\nsurprise or inextinguishable laughter, but presently a fair-haired\\nlittle creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name. They\\nhad to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other,\\nand my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their\\nlanguage caused an immense amount of genuine, if uncivil, amusement.\\nHowever, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children, and persisted, and\\npresently I had a score of noun substantives at least at my command;\\nand then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and even the verb ‘to eat.’\\nBut it was slow work, and the little people soon tired and wanted to\\nget away from my interrogations, so I determined, rather of necessity,\\nto let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined.\\nAnd very little doses I found they were before long, for I never met\\npeople more indolent or more easily fatigued.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n VI.\\n The Sunset of Mankind\\n\\n\\n“A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was\\ntheir lack of interest. They would come to me with eager cries of\\nastonishment, like children, but, like children they would soon stop\\nexamining me, and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my\\nconversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that almost\\nall those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is odd, too, how\\nspeedily I came to disregard these little people. I went out through\\nthe portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was\\nsatisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men of the future,\\nwho would follow me a little distance, chatter and laugh about me, and,\\nhaving smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way, leave me again to my\\nown devices.\\n\\n“The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great\\nhall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun. At\\nfirst things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely different\\nfrom the world I had known—even the flowers. The big building I had\\nleft was situated on the slope of a broad river valley, but the Thames\\nhad shifted, perhaps, a mile from its present position. I resolved to\\nmount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a mile and a half away, from\\nwhich I could get a wider view of this our planet in the year Eight\\nHundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One, A.D. For that, I should\\nexplain, was the date the little dials of my machine recorded.\\n\\n“As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly\\nhelp to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I found the\\nworld—for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for instance, was a\\ngreat heap of granite, bound together by masses of aluminium, a vast\\nlabyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps, amidst which were\\nthick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like plants—nettles possibly—but\\nwonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves, and incapable of\\nstinging. It was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure,\\nto what end built I could not determine. It was here that I was\\ndestined, at a later date, to have a very strange experience—the first\\nintimation of a still stranger discovery—but of that I will speak in\\nits proper place.\\n\\n“Looking round, with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I rested\\nfor a while, I realised that there were no small houses to be seen.\\nApparently the single house, and possibly even the household, had\\nvanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like buildings,\\nbut the house and the cottage, which form such characteristic features\\nof our own English landscape, had disappeared.\\n\\n“‘Communism,’ said I to myself.\\n\\n“And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the\\nhalf-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash, I\\nperceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft hairless\\nvisage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem strange,\\nperhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything was so\\nstrange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and in all the\\ndifferences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from\\neach other, these people of the future were alike. And the children\\nseemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents. I judged\\nthen that the children of that time were extremely precocious,\\nphysically at least, and I found afterwards abundant verification of my\\nopinion.\\n\\n“Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I felt\\nthat this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would\\nexpect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman, the\\ninstitution of the family, and the differentiation of occupations are\\nmere militant necessities of an age of physical force. Where population\\nis balanced and abundant, much childbearing becomes an evil rather than\\na blessing to the State; where violence comes but rarely and offspring\\nare secure, there is less necessity—indeed there is no necessity—for an\\nefficient family, and the specialisation of the sexes with reference to\\ntheir children’s needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even\\nin our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I must\\nremind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to appreciate\\nhow far it fell short of the reality.\\n\\n“While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by a\\npretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in a\\ntransitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then resumed\\nthe thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings towards\\nthe top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently\\nmiraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a\\nstrange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.\\n\\n“There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognise,\\ncorroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in\\nsoft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of\\ngriffins’ heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of our\\nold world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and fair a\\nview as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the horizon\\nand the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal bars of\\npurple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in which the\\nriver lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already spoken of the\\ngreat palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery, some in ruins\\nand some still occupied. Here and there rose a white or silvery figure\\nin the waste garden of the earth, here and there came the sharp\\nvertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There were no hedges, no signs\\nof proprietary rights, no evidences of agriculture; the whole earth had\\nbecome a garden.\\n\\n“So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had\\nseen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation was\\nsomething in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a half\\ntruth—or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)\\n\\n“It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane. The\\nruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the first\\ntime I began to realise an odd consequence of the social effort in\\nwhich we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think, it is a\\nlogical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need; security\\nsets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the conditions\\nof life—the true civilising process that makes life more and more\\nsecure—had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a united\\nhumanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are now mere\\ndreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried\\nforward. And the harvest was what I saw!\\n\\n“After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still in\\nthe rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but a\\nlittle department of the field of human disease, but, even so, it\\nspreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our agriculture\\nand horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate\\nperhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number\\nto fight out a balance as they can. We improve our favourite plants and\\nanimals—and how few they are—gradually by selective breeding; now a new\\nand better peach, now a seedless grape, now a sweeter and larger\\nflower, now a more convenient breed of cattle. We improve them\\ngradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and our\\nknowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and slow in our\\nclumsy hands. Some day all this will be better organised, and still\\nbetter. That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. The\\nwhole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things\\nwill move faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature. In the\\nend, wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and\\nvegetable life to suit our human needs.\\n\\n“This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done\\nindeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine had\\nleapt. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or fungi;\\neverywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers; brilliant\\nbutterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of preventive medicine\\nwas attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I saw no evidence of any\\ncontagious diseases during all my stay. And I shall have to tell you\\nlater that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been\\nprofoundly affected by these changes.\\n\\n“Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in\\nsplendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them\\nengaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social nor\\neconomical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all that\\ncommerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It was\\nnatural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of a\\nsocial paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been met,\\nI guessed, and population had ceased to increase.\\n\\n“But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the\\nchange. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is the\\ncause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom:\\nconditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and the\\nweaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the loyal\\nalliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and decision.\\nAnd the institution of the family, and the emotions that arise therein,\\nthe fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring, parental\\nself-devotion, all found their justification and support in the\\nimminent dangers of the young. _Now_, where are these imminent dangers?\\nThere is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against connubial\\njealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion of all sorts;\\nunnecessary things now, and things that make us uncomfortable, savage\\nsurvivals, discords in a refined and pleasant life.\\n\\n“I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of\\nintelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my\\nbelief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes\\nQuiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had\\nused all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it\\nlived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.\\n\\n“Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that\\nrestless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness. Even\\nin our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary to\\nsurvival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and the\\nlove of battle, for instance, are no great help—may even be\\nhindrances—to a civilised man. And in a state of physical balance and\\nsecurity, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out of\\nplace. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of war or\\nsolitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting disease to\\nrequire strength of constitution, no need of toil. For such a life,\\nwhat we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong, are\\nindeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they are, for the strong\\nwould be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet. No doubt\\nthe exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw was the outcome of the last\\nsurgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settled\\ndown into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived—the\\nflourish of that triumph which began the last great peace. This has\\never been the fate of energy in security; it takes to art and to\\neroticism, and then come languor and decay.\\n\\n“Even this artistic impetus would at last die away—had almost died in\\nthe Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing in\\nthe sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and no more.\\nEven that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity. We are\\nkept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity, and it seemed to me\\nthat here was that hateful grindstone broken at last!\\n\\n“As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this simple\\nexplanation I had mastered the problem of the world—mastered the whole\\nsecret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they had devised\\nfor the increase of population had succeeded too well, and their\\nnumbers had rather diminished than kept stationary. That would account\\nfor the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my explanation, and plausible\\nenough—as most wrong theories are!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n VII.\\n A Sudden Shock\\n\\n\\n“As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the full\\nmoon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver light in\\nthe north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move about below, a\\nnoiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the chill of the night. I\\ndetermined to descend and find where I could sleep.\\n\\n“I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to the\\nfigure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing\\ndistinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see the\\nsilver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron bushes,\\nblack in the pale light, and there was the little lawn. I looked at the\\nlawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency. ‘No,’ said I stoutly\\nto myself, ‘that was not the lawn.’\\n\\n“But it _was_ the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was\\ntowards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came home to\\nme? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!\\n\\n“At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of losing\\nmy own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world. The bare\\nthought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could feel it grip me\\nat the throat and stop my breathing. In another moment I was in a\\npassion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope.\\nOnce I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost no time in stanching the\\nblood, but jumped up and ran on, with a warm trickle down my cheek and\\nchin. All the time I ran I was saying to myself: ‘They have moved it a\\nlittle, pushed it under the bushes out of the way.’ Nevertheless, I ran\\nwith all my might. All the time, with the certainty that sometimes\\ncomes with excessive dread, I knew that such assurance was folly, knew\\ninstinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach. My breath\\ncame with pain. I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill\\ncrest to the little lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am\\nnot a young man. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in\\nleaving the machine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and\\nnone answered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit\\nworld.\\n\\n“When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realised. Not a trace of\\nthe thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the empty\\nspace among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it furiously, as if\\nthe thing might be hidden in a corner, and then stopped abruptly, with\\nmy hands clutching my hair. Above me towered the sphinx, upon the\\nbronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in the light of the rising\\nmoon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my dismay.\\n\\n“I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put\\nthe mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of their\\nphysical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed me: the\\nsense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose intervention my\\ninvention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt assured: unless some\\nother age had produced its exact duplicate, the machine could not have\\nmoved in time. The attachment of the levers—I will show you the method\\nlater—prevented anyone from tampering with it in that way when they\\nwere removed. It had moved, and was hid, only in space. But then, where\\ncould it be?\\n\\n“I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running violently\\nin and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx, and startling\\nsome white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a small deer. I\\nremember, too, late that night, beating the bushes with my clenched\\nfist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs.\\nThen, sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind, I went down to the\\ngreat building of stone. The big hall was dark, silent, and deserted. I\\nslipped on the uneven floor, and fell over one of the malachite tables,\\nalmost breaking my shin. I lit a match and went on past the dusty\\ncurtains, of which I have told you.\\n\\n“There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon which,\\nperhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I have no\\ndoubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming suddenly\\nout of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter and\\nflare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches. ‘Where is my\\nTime Machine?’ I began, bawling like an angry child, laying hands upon\\nthem and shaking them up together. It must have been very queer to\\nthem. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely frightened. When I saw\\nthem standing round me, it came into my head that I was doing as\\nfoolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the\\ncircumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear. For,\\nreasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear must be\\nforgotten.\\n\\n“Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and knocking one of the people over\\nin my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again, out\\nunder the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little feet\\nrunning and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all I did as\\nthe moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected nature of my\\nloss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind—a\\nstrange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved to and fro,\\nscreaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory of horrible\\nfatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of looking in this\\nimpossible place and that; of groping among moonlit ruins and touching\\nstrange creatures in the black shadows; at last, of lying on the ground\\nnear the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness, even anger at\\nthe folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength. I\\nhad nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when I woke again it was\\nfull day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf\\nwithin reach of my arm.\\n\\n“I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I had\\ngot there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion and\\ndespair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain, reasonable\\ndaylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the face. I saw the\\nwild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could reason with myself.\\n‘Suppose the worst?’ I said. ‘Suppose the machine altogether\\nlost—perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be calm and patient, to learn\\nthe way of the people, to get a clear idea of the method of my loss,\\nand the means of getting materials and tools; so that in the end,\\nperhaps, I may make another.’ That would be my only hope, a poor hope,\\nperhaps, but better than despair. And, after all, it was a beautiful\\nand curious world.\\n\\n“But probably the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must be\\ncalm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force or\\ncunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about me,\\nwondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and travel-soiled.\\nThe freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness. I had\\nexhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about my business, I found\\nmyself wondering at my intense excitement overnight. I made a careful\\nexamination of the ground about the little lawn. I wasted some time in\\nfutile questionings, conveyed, as well as I was able, to such of the\\nlittle people as came by. They all failed to understand my gestures;\\nsome were simply stolid, some thought it was a jest and laughed at me.\\nI had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty\\nlaughing faces. It was a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of\\nfear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage\\nof my perplexity. The turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped\\nin it, about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of\\nmy feet where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine.\\nThere were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow footprints\\nlike those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed my closer\\nattention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said, of bronze.\\nIt was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep framed panels\\non either side. I went and rapped at these. The pedestal was hollow.\\nExamining the panels with care I found them discontinuous with the\\nframes. There were no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, if\\nthey were doors, as I supposed, opened from within. One thing was clear\\nenough to my mind. It took no very great mental effort to infer that my\\nTime Machine was inside that pedestal. But how it got there was a\\ndifferent problem.\\n\\n“I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes\\nand under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned smiling\\nto them, and beckoned them to me. They came, and then, pointing to the\\nbronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open it. But at my\\nfirst gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I don’t know how to\\nconvey their expression to you. Suppose you were to use a grossly\\nimproper gesture to a delicate-minded woman—it is how she would look.\\nThey went off as if they had received the last possible insult. I tried\\na sweet-looking little chap in white next, with exactly the same\\nresult. Somehow, his manner made me feel ashamed of myself. But, as you\\nknow, I wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once more. As he\\nturned off, like the others, my temper got the better of me. In three\\nstrides I was after him, had him by the loose part of his robe round\\nthe neck, and began dragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw the\\nhorror and repugnance of his face, and all of a sudden I let him go.\\n\\n“But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze panels.\\nI thought I heard something stir inside—to be explicit, I thought I\\nheard a sound like a chuckle—but I must have been mistaken. Then I got\\na big pebble from the river, and came and hammered till I had flattened\\na coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off in powdery\\nflakes. The delicate little people must have heard me hammering in\\ngusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it. I\\nsaw a crowd of them upon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last,\\nhot and tired, I sat down to watch the place. But I was too restless to\\nwatch long; I am too Occidental for a long vigil. I could work at a\\nproblem for years, but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours—that is\\nanother matter.\\n\\n“I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the bushes\\ntowards the hill again. ‘Patience,’ said I to myself. ‘If you want your\\nmachine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they mean to take\\nyour machine away, it’s little good your wrecking their bronze panels,\\nand if they don’t, you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it.\\nTo sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is\\nhopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this world. Learn its ways,\\nwatch it, be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning. In the end\\nyou will find clues to it all.’ Then suddenly the humour of the\\nsituation came into my mind: the thought of the years I had spent in\\nstudy and toil to get into the future age, and now my passion of\\nanxiety to get out of it. I had made myself the most complicated and\\nthe most hopeless trap that ever a man devised. Although it was at my\\nown expense, I could not help myself. I laughed aloud.\\n\\n“Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little people\\navoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had something to\\ndo with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt tolerably sure\\nof the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no concern and to\\nabstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day or two\\nthings got back to the old footing. I made what progress I could in the\\nlanguage, and in addition I pushed my explorations here and there.\\nEither I missed some subtle point or their language was excessively\\nsimple—almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs.\\nThere seemed to be few, if any, abstract terms, or little use of\\nfigurative language. Their sentences were usually simple and of two\\nwords, and I failed to convey or understand any but the simplest\\npropositions. I determined to put the thought of my Time Machine and\\nthe mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx, as much as possible\\nin a corner of memory, until my growing knowledge would lead me back to\\nthem in a natural way. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand,\\ntethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n VIII.\\n Explanation\\n\\n\\n“So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant\\nrichness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the same\\nabundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material and\\nstyle, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same\\nblossom-laden trees and tree ferns. Here and there water shone like\\nsilver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and so\\nfaded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which presently\\nattracted my attention, was the presence of certain circular wells,\\nseveral, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth. One lay by the path\\nup the hill which I had followed during my first walk. Like the others,\\nit was rimmed with bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little\\ncupola from the rain. Sitting by the side of these wells, and peering\\ndown into the shafted darkness, I could see no gleam of water, nor\\ncould I start any reflection with a lighted match. But in all of them I\\nheard a certain sound: a thud—thud—thud, like the beating of some big\\nengine; and I discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady\\ncurrent of air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper\\ninto the throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was\\nat once sucked swiftly out of sight.\\n\\n“After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers\\nstanding here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was often\\njust such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a\\nsun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong\\nsuggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose\\ntrue import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to\\nassociate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an\\nobvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong.\\n\\n“And here I must admit that I learnt very little of drains and bells\\nand modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my time in\\nthis real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and coming times\\nwhich I have read, there is a vast amount of detail about building, and\\nsocial arrangements, and so forth. But while such details are easy\\nenough to obtain when the whole world is contained in one’s\\nimagination, they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid\\nsuch realities as I found here. Conceive the tale of London which a\\nnegro, fresh from Central Africa, would take back to his tribe! What\\nwould he know of railway companies, of social movements, of telephone\\nand telegraph wires, of the Parcels Delivery Company, and postal orders\\nand the like? Yet we, at least, should be willing enough to explain\\nthese things to him! And even of what he knew, how much could he make\\nhis untravelled friend either apprehend or believe? Then, think how\\nnarrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times, and\\nhow wide the interval between myself and these of the Golden Age! I was\\nsensible of much which was unseen, and which contributed to my comfort;\\nbut save for a general impression of automatic organisation, I fear I\\ncan convey very little of the difference to your mind.\\n\\n“In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of\\ncrematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me\\nthat, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere\\nbeyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I\\ndeliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely\\ndefeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make a\\nfurther remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm among\\nthis people there were none.\\n\\n“I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an\\nautomatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure. Yet\\nI could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The several big\\npalaces I had explored were mere living places, great dining-halls and\\nsleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no appliances of any\\nkind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at\\ntimes need renewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, were fairly\\ncomplex specimens of metalwork. Somehow such things must be made. And\\nthe little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency. There\\nwere no shops, no workshops, no sign of importations among them. They\\nspent all their time in playing gently, in bathing in the river, in\\nmaking love in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I\\ncould not see how things were kept going.\\n\\n“Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what, had\\ntaken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. _Why?_ For the\\nlife of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too, those\\nflickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt—how shall I put it?\\nSuppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and there in\\nexcellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others made up of\\nwords, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well, on the third\\nday of my visit, that was how the world of Eight Hundred and Two\\nThousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to me!\\n\\n“That day, too, I made a friend—of a sort. It happened that, as I was\\nwatching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them\\nwas seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main current\\nran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer.\\nIt will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in these\\ncreatures, when I tell you that none made the slightest attempt to\\nrescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their\\neyes. When I realised this, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, and,\\nwading in at a point lower down, I caught the poor mite and drew her\\nsafe to land. A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round, and\\nI had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her. I\\nhad got to such a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any\\ngratitude from her. In that, however, I was wrong.\\n\\n“This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little woman,\\nas I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre from an\\nexploration, and she received me with cries of delight and presented me\\nwith a big garland of flowers—evidently made for me and me alone. The\\nthing took my imagination. Very possibly I had been feeling desolate.\\nAt any rate I did my best to display my appreciation of the gift. We\\nwere soon seated together in a little stone arbour, engaged in\\nconversation, chiefly of smiles. The creature’s friendliness affected\\nme exactly as a child’s might have done. We passed each other flowers,\\nand she kissed my hands. I did the same to hers. Then I tried talk, and\\nfound that her name was Weena, which, though I don’t know what it\\nmeant, somehow seemed appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a\\nqueer friendship which lasted a week, and ended—as I will tell you!\\n\\n“She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She\\ntried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it\\nwent to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and\\ncalling after me rather plaintively. But the problems of the world had\\nto be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come into the future to\\ncarry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress when I left her was\\nvery great, her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic,\\nand I think, altogether, I had as much trouble as comfort from her\\ndevotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow, a very great comfort. I\\nthought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me. Until\\nit was too late, I did not clearly know what I had inflicted upon her\\nwhen I left her. Nor until it was too late did I clearly understand\\nwhat she was to me. For, by merely seeming fond of me, and showing in\\nher weak, futile way that she cared for me, the little doll of a\\ncreature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the White\\nSphinx almost the feeling of coming home; and I would watch for her\\ntiny figure of white and gold so soon as I came over the hill.\\n\\n“It was from her, too, that I learnt that fear had not yet left the\\nworld. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest\\nconfidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made threatening\\ngrimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she dreaded the\\ndark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness to her was the\\none thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it set\\nme thinking and observing. I discovered then, among other things, that\\nthese little people gathered into the great houses after dark, and\\nslept in droves. To enter upon them without a light was to put them\\ninto a tumult of apprehension. I never found one out of doors, or one\\nsleeping alone within doors, after dark. Yet I was still such a\\nblockhead that I missed the lesson of that fear, and in spite of\\nWeena’s distress, I insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering\\nmultitudes.\\n\\n“It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me\\ntriumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including\\nthe last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm. But\\nmy story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been the\\nnight before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had been\\nrestless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea\\nanemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps. I woke with a\\nstart, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed\\nout of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again, but I felt restless\\nand uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour when things are just\\ncreeping out of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut,\\nand yet unreal. I got up, and went down into the great hall, and so out\\nupon the flagstones in front of the palace. I thought I would make a\\nvirtue of necessity, and see the sunrise.\\n\\n“The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of\\ndawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky black,\\nthe ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless. And up the\\nhill I thought I could see ghosts. Three several times, as I scanned\\nthe slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw a solitary white,\\nape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near the\\nruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body. They moved\\nhastily. I did not see what became of them. It seemed that they\\nvanished among the bushes. The dawn was still indistinct, you must\\nunderstand. I was feeling that chill, uncertain, early-morning feeling\\nyou may have known. I doubted my eyes.\\n\\n“As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on and\\nits vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned the\\nview keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were mere\\ncreatures of the half-light. ‘They must have been ghosts,’ I said; ‘I\\nwonder whence they dated.’ For a queer notion of Grant Allen’s came\\ninto my head, and amused me. If each generation die and leave ghosts,\\nhe argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with them. On that\\ntheory they would have grown innumerable some Eight Hundred Thousand\\nYears hence, and it was no great wonder to see four at once. But the\\njest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these figures all the\\nmorning, until Weena’s rescue drove them out of my head. I associated\\nthem in some indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in my\\nfirst passionate search for the Time Machine. But Weena was a pleasant\\nsubstitute. Yet all the same, they were soon destined to take far\\ndeadlier possession of my mind.\\n\\n“I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of\\nthis Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun was\\nhotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that the sun\\nwill go on cooling steadily in the future. But people, unfamiliar with\\nsuch speculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget that the\\nplanets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body. As\\nthese catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze with renewed energy; and\\nit may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate. Whatever the\\nreason, the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know\\nit.\\n\\n“Well, one very hot morning—my fourth, I think—as I was seeking shelter\\nfrom the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where I\\nslept and fed, there happened this strange thing. Clambering among\\nthese heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery, whose end and side\\nwindows were blocked by fallen masses of stone. By contrast with the\\nbrilliancy outside, it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me. I\\nentered it groping, for the change from light to blackness made spots\\nof colour swim before me. Suddenly I halted spellbound. A pair of eyes,\\nluminous by reflection against the daylight without, was watching me\\nout of the darkness.\\n\\n“The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched my\\nhands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was afraid to\\nturn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity\\nappeared to be living came to my mind. And then I remembered that\\nstrange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to some extent, I\\nadvanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my voice was harsh and\\nill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched something soft. At once\\nthe eyes darted sideways, and something white ran past me. I turned\\nwith my heart in my mouth, and saw a queer little ape-like figure, its\\nhead held down in a peculiar manner, running across the sunlit space\\nbehind me. It blundered against a block of granite, staggered aside,\\nand in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of\\nruined masonry.\\n\\n“My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a dull\\nwhite, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there was\\nflaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it went too\\nfast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it ran on all\\nfours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an instant’s\\npause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could not find it\\nat first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I came upon one\\nof those round well-like openings of which I have told you, half closed\\nby a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me. Could this Thing have\\nvanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and, looking down, I saw a\\nsmall, white, moving creature, with large bright eyes which regarded me\\nsteadfastly as it retreated. It made me shudder. It was so like a human\\nspider! It was clambering down the wall, and now I saw for the first\\ntime a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder\\ndown the shaft. Then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my\\nhand, going out as it dropped, and when I had lit another the little\\nmonster had disappeared.\\n\\n“I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for\\nsome time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I\\nhad seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that Man\\nhad not remained one species, but had differentiated into two distinct\\nanimals: that my graceful children of the Upper World were not the sole\\ndescendants of our generation, but that this bleached, obscene,\\nnocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir to all the\\nages.\\n\\n“I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground\\nventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And what, I\\nwondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced\\norganisation? How was it related to the indolent serenity of the\\nbeautiful Overworlders? And what was hidden down there, at the foot of\\nthat shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that, at any\\nrate, there was nothing to fear, and that there I must descend for the\\nsolution of my difficulties. And withal I was absolutely afraid to go!\\nAs I hesitated, two of the beautiful upperworld people came running in\\ntheir amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow. The male pursued\\nthe female, flinging flowers at her as he ran.\\n\\n“They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned\\npillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form to\\nremark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried to\\nframe a question about it in their tongue, they were still more visibly\\ndistressed and turned away. But they were interested by my matches, and\\nI struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about the well, and\\nagain I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to go back to Weena,\\nand see what I could get from her. But my mind was already in\\nrevolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a\\nnew adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these wells, to the\\nventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to say nothing of a\\nhint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the Time\\nMachine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution\\nof the economic problem that had puzzled me.\\n\\n“Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was\\nsubterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which made\\nme think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a\\nlong-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was the\\nbleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark—the\\nwhite fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then, those large eyes,\\nwith that capacity for reflecting light, are common features of\\nnocturnal things—witness the owl and the cat. And last of all, that\\nevident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty yet fumbling awkward\\nflight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar carriage of the head\\nwhile in the light—all reinforced the theory of an extreme\\nsensitiveness of the retina.\\n\\n“Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and\\nthese tunnellings were the habitat of the New Race. The presence of\\nventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes—everywhere, in fact,\\nexcept along the river valley—showed how universal were its\\nramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in this\\nartificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of\\nthe daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible that I at once\\naccepted it, and went on to assume the _how_ of this splitting of the\\nhuman species. I dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory;\\nthough, for myself, I very soon felt that it fell far short of the\\ntruth.\\n\\n“At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed clear\\nas daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely\\ntemporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer\\nwas the key to the whole position. No doubt it will seem grotesque\\nenough to you—and wildly incredible!—and yet even now there are\\nexisting circumstances to point that way. There is a tendency to\\nutilise underground space for the less ornamental purposes of\\ncivilisation; there is the Metropolitan Railway in London, for\\ninstance, there are new electric railways, there are subways, there are\\nunderground workrooms and restaurants, and they increase and multiply.\\nEvidently, I thought, this tendency had increased till Industry had\\ngradually lost its birthright in the sky. I mean that it had gone\\ndeeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories,\\nspending a still-increasing amount of its time therein, till, in the\\nend—! Even now, does not an East-end worker live in such artificial\\nconditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the\\nearth?\\n\\n“Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people—due, no doubt, to the\\nincreasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf between\\nthem and the rude violence of the poor—is already leading to the\\nclosing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the surface of\\nthe land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the prettier country\\nis shut in against intrusion. And this same widening gulf—which is due\\nto the length and expense of the higher educational process and the\\nincreased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the\\npart of the rich—will make that exchange between class and class, that\\npromotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of\\nour species along lines of social stratification, less and less\\nfrequent. So, in the end, above ground you must have the Haves,\\npursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below ground the\\nHave-nots, the Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of\\ntheir labour. Once they were there, they would no doubt have to pay\\nrent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and\\nif they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such\\nof them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would\\ndie; and, in the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would\\nbecome as well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as\\nhappy in their way, as the Overworld people were to theirs. As it\\nseemed to me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed\\nnaturally enough.\\n\\n“The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different shape\\nin my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and general\\nco-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real aristocracy,\\narmed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the\\nindustrial system of today. Its triumph had not been simply a triumph\\nover Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the fellow-man. This, I must\\nwarn you, was my theory at the time. I had no convenient cicerone in\\nthe pattern of the Utopian books. My explanation may be absolutely\\nwrong. I still think it is the most plausible one. But even on this\\nsupposition the balanced civilisation that was at last attained must\\nhave long since passed its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay.\\nThe too-perfect security of the Overworlders had led them to a slow\\nmovement of degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and\\nintelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had\\nhappened to the Undergrounders I did not yet suspect; but, from what I\\nhad seen of the Morlocks—that, by the bye, was the name by which these\\ncreatures were called—I could imagine that the modification of the\\nhuman type was even far more profound than among the ‘Eloi,’ the\\nbeautiful race that I already knew.\\n\\n“Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time\\nMachine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if the\\nEloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And why\\nwere they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have said,\\nto question Weena about this Underworld, but here again I was\\ndisappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and\\npresently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the topic\\nwas unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little harshly, she\\nburst into tears. They were the only tears, except my own, I ever saw\\nin that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased abruptly to trouble about\\nthe Morlocks, and was only concerned in banishing these signs of her\\nhuman inheritance from Weena’s eyes. And very soon she was smiling and\\nclapping her hands, while I solemnly burnt a match.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n IX.\\n The Morlocks\\n\\n\\n“It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow up\\nthe new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt a\\npeculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the\\nhalf-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in\\nspirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the\\ntouch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic\\ninfluence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to\\nappreciate.\\n\\n“The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a little\\ndisordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once or twice I\\nhad a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive no definite\\nreason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the\\nlittle people were sleeping in the moonlight—that night Weena was among\\nthem—and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me even\\nthen, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its\\nlast quarter, and the nights grow dark, when the appearances of these\\nunpleasant creatures from below, these whitened Lemurs, this new vermin\\nthat had replaced the old, might be more abundant. And on both these\\ndays I had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty. I\\nfelt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by boldly\\npenetrating these mysteries of underground. Yet I could not face the\\nmystery. If only I had had a companion it would have been different.\\nBut I was so horribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness\\nof the well appalled me. I don’t know if you will understand my\\nfeeling, but I never felt quite safe at my back.\\n\\n“It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me\\nfarther and farther afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the\\nsouth-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe\\nWood, I observed far-off, in the direction of nineteenth-century\\nBanstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any I had\\nhitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins I\\nknew, and the façade had an Oriental look: the face of it having the\\nlustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind of bluish-green, of a\\ncertain type of Chinese porcelain. This difference in aspect suggested\\na difference in use, and I was minded to push on and explore. But the\\nday was growing late, and I had come upon the sight of the place after\\na long and tiring circuit; so I resolved to hold over the adventure for\\nthe following day, and I returned to the welcome and the caresses of\\nlittle Weena. But next morning I perceived clearly enough that my\\ncuriosity regarding the Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece of\\nself-deception, to enable me to shirk, by another day, an experience I\\ndreaded. I resolved I would make the descent without further waste of\\ntime, and started out in the early morning towards a well near the\\nruins of granite and aluminium.\\n\\n“Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but when\\nshe saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed strangely\\ndisconcerted. ‘Good-bye, little Weena,’ I said, kissing her; and then\\nputting her down, I began to feel over the parapet for the climbing\\nhooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for I feared my courage\\nmight leak away! At first she watched me in amazement. Then she gave a\\nmost piteous cry, and running to me, she began to pull at me with her\\nlittle hands. I think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed. I\\nshook her off, perhaps a little roughly, and in another moment I was in\\nthe throat of the well. I saw her agonised face over the parapet, and\\nsmiled to reassure her. Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks\\nto which I clung.\\n\\n“I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The\\ndescent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the\\nsides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of a creature\\nmuch smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily cramped and\\nfatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of the bars bent\\nsuddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into the blackness\\nbeneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after that experience I\\ndid not dare to rest again. Though my arms and back were presently\\nacutely painful, I went on clambering down the sheer descent with as\\nquick a motion as possible. Glancing upward, I saw the aperture, a\\nsmall blue disc, in which a star was visible, while little Weena’s head\\nshowed as a round black projection. The thudding sound of a machine\\nbelow grew louder and more oppressive. Everything save that little disc\\nabove was profoundly dark, and when I looked up again Weena had\\ndisappeared.\\n\\n“I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go up\\nthe shaft again, and leave the Underworld alone. But even while I\\nturned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with\\nintense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a\\nslender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the\\naperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and\\nrest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I\\nwas trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the\\nunbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air\\nwas full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft.\\n\\n“I do not know how long I lay. I was arroused by a soft hand touching\\nmy face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and,\\nhastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar to\\nthe one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating before\\nthe light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me impenetrable\\ndarkness, their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive, just as are\\nthe pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they reflected the light in the\\nsame way. I have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity,\\nand they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light. But,\\nso soon as I struck a match in order to see them, they fled\\nincontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from which\\ntheir eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion.\\n\\n“I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently\\ndifferent from that of the Overworld people; so that I was needs left\\nto my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before exploration\\nwas even then in my mind. But I said to myself, ‘You are in for it\\nnow,’ and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the noise of\\nmachinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from me, and I\\ncame to a large open space, and striking another match, saw that I had\\nentered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into utter darkness\\nbeyond the range of my light. The view I had of it was as much as one\\ncould see in the burning of a match.\\n\\n“Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose\\nout of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim\\nspectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the bye, was\\nvery stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly-shed blood\\nwas in the air. Some way down the central vista was a little table of\\nwhite metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The Morlocks at any rate\\nwere carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember wondering what large\\nanimal could have survived to furnish the red joint I saw. It was all\\nvery indistinct: the heavy smell, the big unmeaning shapes, the obscene\\nfigures lurking in the shadows, and only waiting for the darkness to\\ncome at me again! Then the match burnt down, and stung my fingers, and\\nfell, a wriggling red spot in the blackness.\\n\\n“I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such an\\nexperience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had started\\nwith the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would certainly\\nbe infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances. I had come\\nwithout arms, without medicine, without anything to smoke—at times I\\nmissed tobacco frightfully!—even without enough matches. If only I had\\nthought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse of the Underworld\\nin a second, and examined it at leisure. But, as it was, I stood there\\nwith only the weapons and the powers that Nature had endowed me\\nwith—hands, feet, and teeth; these, and four safety-matches that still\\nremained to me.\\n\\n“I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark,\\nand it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered that my\\nstore of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me until that\\nmoment that there was any need to economise them, and I had wasted\\nalmost half the box in astonishing the Overworlders, to whom fire was a\\nnovelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I stood in the dark,\\na hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling over my face, and I was\\nsensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the\\nbreathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me. I felt\\nthe box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged, and other hands\\nbehind me plucking at my clothing. The sense of these unseen creatures\\nexamining me was indescribably unpleasant. The sudden realisation of my\\nignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very\\nvividly in the darkness. I shouted at them as loudly as I could. They\\nstarted away, and then I could feel them approaching me again. They\\nclutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I\\nshivered violently, and shouted again—rather discordantly. This time\\nthey were not so seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing\\nnoise as they came back at me. I will confess I was horribly\\nfrightened. I determined to strike another match and escape under the\\nprotection of its glare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a\\nscrap of paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow\\ntunnel. But I had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and\\nin the blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among\\nleaves, and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me.\\n\\n“In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no\\nmistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another\\nlight, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine how\\nnauseatingly inhuman they looked—those pale, chinless faces and great,\\nlidless, pinkish-grey eyes!—as they stared in their blindness and\\nbewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise you: I retreated\\nagain, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third. It had\\nalmost burnt through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay\\ndown on the edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy.\\nThen I felt sideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my\\nfeet were grasped from behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I\\nlit my last match … and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on\\nthe climbing bars now, and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from\\nthe clutches of the Morlocks, and was speedily clambering up the shaft,\\nwhile they stayed peering and blinking up at me: all but one little\\nwretch who followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a\\ntrophy.\\n\\n“That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or thirty\\nfeet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest difficulty\\nin keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful struggle against\\nthis faintness. Several times my head swam, and I felt all the\\nsensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the well-mouth\\nsomehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight. I\\nfell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean. Then I remember\\nWeena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of others among the\\nEloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n X.\\n When Night Came\\n\\n\\n“Now, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto, except\\nduring my night’s anguish at the loss of the Time Machine, I had felt a\\nsustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was staggered by\\nthese new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought myself impeded by\\nthe childish simplicity of the little people, and by some unknown\\nforces which I had only to understand to overcome; but there was an\\naltogether new element in the sickening quality of the Morlocks—a\\nsomething inhuman and malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, I\\nhad felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was\\nwith the pit and how to get out of it. Now I felt like a beast in a\\ntrap, whose enemy would come upon him soon.\\n\\n“The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the new\\nmoon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible\\nremarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now such a very difficult\\nproblem to guess what the coming Dark Nights might mean. The moon was\\non the wane: each night there was a longer interval of darkness. And I\\nnow understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear of\\nthe little Upperworld people for the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul\\nvillainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt\\npretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upperworld\\npeople might once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks\\ntheir mechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two\\nspecies that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down\\ntowards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new relationship. The\\nEloi, like the Carlovignan kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful\\nfutility. They still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the\\nMorlocks, subterranean for innumerable generations, had come at last to\\nfind the daylit surface intolerable. And the Morlocks made their\\ngarments, I inferred, and maintained them in their habitual needs,\\nperhaps through the survival of an old habit of service. They did it as\\na standing horse paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals\\nin sport: because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on\\nthe organism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed.\\nThe Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago,\\nthousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of the\\nease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back—changed!\\nAlready the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew. They were\\nbecoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came into my head\\nthe memory of the meat I had seen in the Underworld. It seemed odd how\\nit floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were by the current of my\\nmeditations, but coming in almost like a question from outside. I tried\\nto recall the form of it. I had a vague sense of something familiar,\\nbut I could not tell what it was at the time.\\n\\n“Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their\\nmysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this age\\nof ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not paralyse\\nand mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend myself.\\nWithout further delay I determined to make myself arms and a fastness\\nwhere I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could face this\\nstrange world with some of that confidence I had lost in realising to\\nwhat creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt I could never sleep\\nagain until my bed was secure from them. I shuddered with horror to\\nthink how they must already have examined me.\\n\\n“I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but\\nfound nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All the\\nbuildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous\\nclimbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the\\ntall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished gleam\\nof its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening, taking Weena\\nlike a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills towards the\\nsouth-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or eight miles, but\\nit must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen the place on a\\nmoist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished. In addition,\\nthe heel of one of my shoes was loose, and a nail was working through\\nthe sole—they were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoors—so that I\\nwas lame. And it was already long past sunset when I came in sight of\\nthe palace, silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky.\\n\\n“Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but after a\\nwhile she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the side of me,\\noccasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my\\npockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at the last she had\\nconcluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases for floral\\ndecoration. At least she utilised them for that purpose. And that\\nreminds me! In changing my jacket I found…”\\n\\n_The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently\\nplaced two withered flowers, not unlike very large white mallows, upon\\nthe little table. Then he resumed his narrative._\\n\\n“As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the\\nhill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to return to\\nthe house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the\\nPalace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand\\nthat we were seeking a refuge there from her Fear. You know that great\\npause that comes upon things before the dusk? Even the breeze stops in\\nthe trees. To me there is always an air of expectation about that\\nevening stillness. The sky was clear, remote, and empty save for a few\\nhorizontal bars far down in the sunset. Well, that night the\\nexpectation took the colour of my fears. In that darkling calm my\\nsenses seemed preternaturally sharpened. I fancied I could even feel\\nthe hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see\\nthrough it the Morlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and\\nwaiting for the dark. In my excitement I fancied that they would\\nreceive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war. And why\\nhad they taken my Time Machine?\\n\\n“So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night. The\\nclear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another came out.\\nThe ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena’s fears and her fatigue\\ngrew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed\\nher. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her arms round my neck,\\nand, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face against my shoulder. So\\nwe went down a long slope into a valley, and there in the dimness I\\nalmost walked into a little river. This I waded, and went up the\\nopposite side of the valley, past a number of sleeping houses, and by a\\nstatue—a Faun, or some such figure, _minus_ the head. Here too were\\nacacias. So far I had seen nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet\\nearly in the night, and the darker hours before the old moon rose were\\nstill to come.\\n\\n“From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide and\\nblack before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either\\nto the right or the left. Feeling tired—my feet, in particular, were\\nvery sore—I carefully lowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted, and\\nsat down upon the turf. I could no longer see the Palace of Green\\nPorcelain, and I was in doubt of my direction. I looked into the\\nthickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide. Under that\\ndense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars. Even\\nwere there no other lurking danger—a danger I did not care to let my\\nimagination loose upon—there would still be all the roots to stumble\\nover and the tree-boles to strike against. I was very tired, too, after\\nthe excitements of the day; so I decided that I would not face it, but\\nwould pass the night upon the open hill.\\n\\n“Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her in\\nmy jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The\\nhillside was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood there\\ncame now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the stars,\\nfor the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of friendly\\ncomfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations had gone from\\nthe sky, however: that slow movement which is imperceptible in a\\nhundred human lifetimes, had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar\\ngroupings. But the Milky Way, it seemed to me, was still the same\\ntattered streamer of star-dust as of yore. Southward (as I judged it)\\nwas a very bright red star that was new to me; it was even more\\nsplendid than our own green Sirius. And amid all these scintillating\\npoints of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the\\nface of an old friend.\\n\\n“Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the\\ngravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable\\ndistance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the\\nunknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great\\nprecessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty\\ntimes had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that I\\nhad traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity, all\\nthe traditions, the complex organisations, the nations, languages,\\nliteratures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as I knew him,\\nhad been swept out of existence. Instead were these frail creatures who\\nhad forgotten their high ancestry, and the white Things of which I went\\nin terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear that was between the two\\nspecies, and for the first time, with a sudden shiver, came the clear\\nknowledge of what the meat I had seen might be. Yet it was too\\nhorrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me, her face white\\nand starlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought.\\n\\n“Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as I\\ncould, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs\\nof the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept very\\nclear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at times. Then,\\nas my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the\\nreflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon rose, thin and\\npeaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing\\nit, the dawn came, pale at first, and then growing pink and warm. No\\nMorlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had seen none upon the hill that\\nnight. And in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that\\nmy fear had been unreasonable. I stood up and found my foot with the\\nloose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat\\ndown again, took off my shoes, and flung them away.\\n\\n“I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and\\npleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit wherewith\\nto break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones, laughing and\\ndancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as\\nthe night. And then I thought once more of the meat that I had seen. I\\nfelt assured now of what it was, and from the bottom of my heart I\\npitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity. Clearly,\\nat some time in the Long-Ago of human decay the Morlocks’ food had run\\nshort. Possibly they had lived on rats and such-like vermin. Even now\\nman is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he\\nwas—far less than any monkey. His prejudice against human flesh is no\\ndeep-seated instinct. And so these inhuman sons of men——! I tried to\\nlook at the thing in a scientific spirit. After all, they were less\\nhuman and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four\\nthousand years ago. And the intelligence that would have made this\\nstate of things a torment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These\\nEloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and\\npreyed upon—probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena\\ndancing at my side!\\n\\n“Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon\\nme, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man\\nhad been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his\\nfellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse, and in the\\nfullness of time Necessity had come home to him. I even tried a\\nCarlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay. But this\\nattitude of mind was impossible. However great their intellectual\\ndegradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim\\nmy sympathy, and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and\\ntheir Fear.\\n\\n“I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue.\\nMy first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to make myself\\nsuch arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That necessity was\\nimmediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some means of fire, so\\nthat I should have the weapon of a torch at hand, for nothing, I knew,\\nwould be more efficient against these Morlocks. Then I wanted to\\narrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the\\nWhite Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had a persuasion that if\\nI could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me I should\\ndiscover the Time Machine and escape. I could not imagine the Morlocks\\nwere strong enough to move it far away. Weena I had resolved to bring\\nwith me to our own time. And turning such schemes over in my mind I\\npursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our\\ndwelling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n XI.\\n The Palace of Green Porcelain\\n\\n\\n“I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about\\nnoon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass\\nremained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had\\nfallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high upon\\na turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was\\nsurprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged\\nWandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then—though I\\nnever followed up the thought—of what might have happened, or might be\\nhappening, to the living things in the sea.\\n\\n“The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed\\nporcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some\\nunknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might help\\nme to interpret this, but I only learnt that the bare idea of writing\\nhad never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, more\\nhuman than she was, perhaps because her affection was so human.\\n\\n“Within the big valves of the door—which were open and broken—we found,\\ninstead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many side windows.\\nAt the first glance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor was\\nthick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was\\nshrouded in the same grey covering. Then I perceived, standing strange\\nand gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearly the lower part of\\na huge skeleton. I recognised by the oblique feet that it was some\\nextinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and\\nthe upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place,\\nwhere rain-water had dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing\\nitself had been worn away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton\\nbarrel of a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going\\ntowards the side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and\\nclearing away the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of\\nour own time. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair\\npreservation of some of their contents.\\n\\n“Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South Kensington!\\nHere, apparently, was the Palæontological Section, and a very splendid\\narray of fossils it must have been, though the inevitable process of\\ndecay that had been staved off for a time, and had, through the\\nextinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine hundredths of its\\nforce, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness\\nat work again upon all its treasures. Here and there I found traces of\\nthe little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or\\nthreaded in strings upon reeds. And the cases had in some instances\\nbeen bodily removed—by the Morlocks, as I judged. The place was very\\nsilent. The thick dust deadened our footsteps. Weena, who had been\\nrolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case, presently came,\\nas I stared about me, and very quietly took my hand and stood beside\\nme.\\n\\n“And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an\\nintellectual age that I gave no thought to the possibilities it\\npresented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a\\nlittle from my mind.\\n\\n“To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain\\nhad a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palæontology; possibly\\nhistorical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me, at least in\\nmy present circumstances, these would be vastly more interesting than\\nthis spectacle of old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another\\nshort gallery running transversely to the first. This appeared to be\\ndevoted to minerals, and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind\\nrunning on gunpowder. But I could find no saltpetre; indeed, no\\nnitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago. Yet the\\nsulphur hung in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the\\nrest of the contents of that gallery, though on the whole they were the\\nbest preserved of all I saw, I had little interest. I am no specialist\\nin mineralogy, and I went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel\\nto the first hall I had entered. Apparently this section had been\\ndevoted to natural history, but everything had long since passed out of\\nrecognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once\\nbeen stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held\\nspirit, a brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for\\nthat, because I should have been glad to trace the patient\\nreadjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been\\nattained. Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but\\nsingularly ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle\\nfrom the end at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from\\nthe ceiling—many of them cracked and smashed—which suggested that\\noriginally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in my\\nelement, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big\\nmachines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some still\\nfairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for mechanism, and\\nI was inclined to linger among these; the more so as for the most part\\nthey had the interest of puzzles, and I could make only the vaguest\\nguesses at what they were for. I fancied that if I could solve their\\npuzzles I should find myself in possession of powers that might be of\\nuse against the Morlocks.\\n\\n“Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she\\nstartled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have\\nnoticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It may\\nbe, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum was\\nbuilt into the side of a hill.—ED.] The end I had come in at was quite\\nabove ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you went down\\nthe length, the ground came up against these windows, until at last\\nthere was a pit like the ‘area‘ of a London house before each, and only\\na narrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling\\nabout the machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the\\ngradual diminution of the light, until Weena’s increasing apprehensions\\ndrew my attention. Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into a\\nthick darkness. I hesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that\\nthe dust was less abundant and its surface less even. Further away\\ntowards the dimness, it appeared to be broken by a number of small\\nnarrow footprints. My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks\\nrevived at that. I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic\\nexamination of machinery. I called to mind that it was already far\\nadvanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge,\\nand no means of making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of\\nthe gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had\\nheard down the well.\\n\\n“I took Weena’s hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her and\\nturned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a\\nsignal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this lever in my\\nhands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly Weena, deserted\\nin the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged the strength of\\nthe lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minute’s strain, and\\nI rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged,\\nfor any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I longed very much to kill\\na Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may think, to want to go killing\\none’s own descendants! But it was impossible, somehow, to feel any\\nhumanity in the things. Only my disinclination to leave Weena, and a\\npersuasion that if I began to slake my thirst for murder my Time\\nMachine might suffer, restrained me from going straight down the\\ngallery and killing the brutes I heard.\\n\\n“Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that\\ngallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first\\nglance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags. The\\nbrown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I presently\\nrecognised as the decaying vestiges of books. They had long since\\ndropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left them. But here\\nand there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the\\ntale well enough. Had I been a literary man I might, perhaps, have\\nmoralised upon the futility of all ambition. But as it was, the thing\\nthat struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to\\nwhich this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified. At the time I\\nwill confess that I thought chiefly of the _Philosophical Transactions_\\nand my own seventeen papers upon physical optics.\\n\\n“Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a\\ngallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little hope of\\nuseful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had collapsed,\\nthis gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every unbroken case.\\nAnd at last, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box of\\nmatches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were perfectly good. They were\\nnot even damp. I turned to Weena. ‘Dance,’ I cried to her in her own\\ntongue. For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we\\nfeared. And so, in that derelict museum, upon the thick soft carpeting\\nof dust, to Weena’s huge delight, I solemnly performed a kind of\\ncomposite dance, whistling _The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I\\ncould. In part it was a modest _cancan_, in part a step dance, in part\\na skirt dance (so far as my tail-coat permitted), and in part original.\\nFor I am naturally inventive, as you know.\\n\\n“Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the\\nwear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for me it was\\na most fortunate, thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier\\nsubstance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that by\\nchance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at\\nfirst that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But\\nthe odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the universal decay this\\nvolatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps through many\\nthousands of centuries. It reminded me of a sepia painting I had once\\nseen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnite that must have perished\\nand become fossilised millions of years ago. I was about to throw it\\naway, but I remembered that it was inflammable and burnt with a good\\nbright flame—was, in fact, an excellent candle—and I put it in my\\npocket. I found no explosives, however, nor any means of breaking down\\nthe bronze doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I\\nhad chanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated.\\n\\n“I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would\\nrequire a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all\\nthe proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms,\\nand how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword. I\\ncould not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised best against\\nthe bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols, and rifles. The\\nmost were masses of rust, but many were of some new metal, and still\\nfairly sound. But any cartridges or powder there may once have been had\\nrotted into dust. One corner I saw was charred and shattered; perhaps,\\nI thought, by an explosion among the specimens. In another place was a\\nvast array of idols—Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phœnician, every\\ncountry on earth, I should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible\\nimpulse, I wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from South\\nAmerica that particularly took my fancy.\\n\\n“As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery\\nafter gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes\\nmere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I\\nsuddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine, and then by the\\nmerest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite\\ncartridges! I shouted ‘Eureka!’ and smashed the case with joy. Then\\ncame a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery, I\\nmade my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in waiting\\nfive, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came. Of course\\nthe things were dummies, as I might have guessed from their presence. I\\nreally believe that had they not been so, I should have rushed off\\nincontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and (as it proved) my\\nchances of finding the Time Machine, all together into non-existence.\\n\\n“It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court within\\nthe palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we rested and\\nrefreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider our position.\\nNight was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible hiding-place had still\\nto be found. But that troubled me very little now. I had in my\\npossession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against\\nthe Morlocks—I had matches! I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a\\nblaze were needed. It seemed to me that the best thing we could do\\nwould be to pass the night in the open, protected by a fire. In the\\nmorning there was the getting of the Time Machine. Towards that, as\\nyet, I had only my iron mace. But now, with my growing knowledge, I\\nfelt very differently towards those bronze doors. Up to this, I had\\nrefrained from forcing them, largely because of the mystery on the\\nother side. They had never impressed me as being very strong, and I\\nhoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n XII.\\n In the Darkness\\n\\n\\n“We emerged from the Palace while the sun was still in part above the\\nhorizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next\\nmorning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods that had\\nstopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as far as\\npossible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep in the\\nprotection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I gathered any\\nsticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms full of such\\nlitter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had anticipated,\\nand besides Weena was tired. And I, also, began to suffer from\\nsleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the wood.\\nUpon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped, fearing the\\ndarkness before us; but a singular sense of impending calamity, that\\nshould indeed have served me as a warning, drove me onward. I had been\\nwithout sleep for a night and two days, and I was feverish and\\nirritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it.\\n\\n“While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against\\ntheir blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was scrub and\\nlong grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from their insidious\\napproach. The forest, I calculated, was rather less than a mile across.\\nIf we could get through it to the bare hillside, there, as it seemed to\\nme, was an altogether safer resting-place; I thought that with my\\nmatches and my camphor I could contrive to keep my path illuminated\\nthrough the woods. Yet it was evident that if I was to flourish matches\\nwith my hands I should have to abandon my firewood; so, rather\\nreluctantly, I put it down. And then it came into my head that I would\\namaze our friends behind by lighting it. I was to discover the\\natrocious folly of this proceeding, but it came to my mind as an\\ningenious move for covering our retreat.\\n\\n“I don’t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be\\nin the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun’s heat is\\nrarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by dewdrops, as\\nis sometimes the case in more tropical districts. Lightning may blast\\nand blacken, but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire. Decaying\\nvegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation,\\nbut this rarely results in flame. In this decadence, too, the art of\\nfire-making had been forgotten on the earth. The red tongues that went\\nlicking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to\\nWeena.\\n\\n“She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have\\ncast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up, and\\nin spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the wood. For\\na little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking back presently,\\nI could see, through the crowded stems, that from my heap of sticks the\\nblaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a curved line of fire was\\ncreeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed at that, and turned again\\nto the dark trees before me. It was very black, and Weena clung to me\\nconvulsively, but there was still, as my eyes grew accustomed to the\\ndarkness, sufficient light for me to avoid the stems. Overhead it was\\nsimply black, except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us\\nhere and there. I lit none of my matches because I had no hand free.\\nUpon my left arm I carried my little one, in my right hand I had my\\niron bar.\\n\\n“For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet,\\nthe faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the\\nthrob of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a\\npattering behind me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more\\ndistinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had heard\\nin the Underworld. There were evidently several of the Morlocks, and\\nthey were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another minute I felt a tug at\\nmy coat, then something at my arm. And Weena shivered violently, and\\nbecame quite still.\\n\\n“It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did so,\\nand, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness\\nabout my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar\\ncooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands, too, were creeping\\nover my coat and back, touching even my neck. Then the match scratched\\nand fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the white backs of the Morlocks\\nin flight amid the trees. I hastily took a lump of camphor from my\\npocket, and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane. Then\\nI looked at Weena. She was lying clutching my feet and quite\\nmotionless, with her face to the ground. With a sudden fright I stooped\\nto her. She seemed scarcely to breathe. I lit the block of camphor and\\nflung it to the ground, and as it split and flared up and drove back\\nthe Morlocks and the shadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood\\nbehind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great company!\\n\\n“She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder and\\nrose to push on, and then there came a horrible realisation. In\\nmanœuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about several\\ntimes, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my\\npath. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the Palace of\\nGreen Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to think rapidly\\nwhat to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp where we were. I\\nput Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy bole, and very hastily,\\nas my first lump of camphor waned, I began collecting sticks and\\nleaves. Here and there out of the darkness round me the Morlocks’ eyes\\nshone like carbuncles.\\n\\n“The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so,\\ntwo white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away.\\nOne was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I\\nfelt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of\\ndismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece of\\ncamphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed how dry\\nwas some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival on the Time\\nMachine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So, instead of casting\\nabout among the trees for fallen twigs, I began leaping up and dragging\\ndown branches. Very soon I had a choking smoky fire of green wood and\\ndry sticks, and could economise my camphor. Then I turned to where\\nWeena lay beside my iron mace. I tried what I could to revive her, but\\nshe lay like one dead. I could not even satisfy myself whether or not\\nshe breathed.\\n\\n“Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have made\\nme heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in the air.\\nMy fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I felt very\\nweary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was full of a\\nslumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just to nod and\\nopen my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had their hands upon\\nme. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket for\\nthe match-box, and—it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me\\nagain. In a moment I knew what had happened. I had slept, and my fire\\nhad gone out, and the bitterness of death came over my soul. The forest\\nseemed full of the smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by\\nthe hair, by the arms, and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible\\nin the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt\\nas if I was in a monstrous spider’s web. I was overpowered, and went\\ndown. I felt little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I\\ndid so my hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I\\nstruggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar\\nshort, I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the\\nsucculent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment I\\nwas free.\\n\\n“The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting\\ncame upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I determined\\nto make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my back to a\\ntree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was full of the\\nstir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices seemed to rise to\\na higher pitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yet none\\ncame within reach. I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came\\nhope. What if the Morlocks were afraid? And close on the heels of that\\ncame a strange thing. The darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly\\nI began to see the Morlocks about me—three battered at my feet—and then\\nI recognised, with incredulous surprise, that the others were running,\\nin an incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through\\nthe wood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish.\\nAs I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of\\nstarlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I understood\\nthe smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was growing now\\ninto a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks’ flight.\\n\\n“Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through the\\nblack pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest. It\\nwas my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for Weena, but\\nshe was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the explosive thud\\nas each fresh tree burst into flame, left little time for reflection.\\nMy iron bar still gripped, I followed in the Morlocks’ path. It was a\\nclose race. Once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I\\nran that I was outflanked and had to strike off to the left. But at\\nlast I emerged upon a small open space, and as I did so, a Morlock came\\nblundering towards me, and past me, and went on straight into the fire!\\n\\n“And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of\\nall that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright as\\nday with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock or\\ntumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was another arm\\nof the burning forest, with yellow tongues already writhing from it,\\ncompletely encircling the space with a fence of fire. Upon the hillside\\nwere some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled by the light and heat, and\\nblundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment.\\nAt first I did not realise their blindness, and struck furiously at\\nthem with my bar, in a frenzy of fear, as they approached me, killing\\none and crippling several more. But when I had watched the gestures of\\none of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky, and heard\\ntheir moans, I was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in\\nthe glare, and I struck no more of them.\\n\\n“Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting\\nloose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one time\\nthe flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would\\npresently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the fight by\\nkilling some of them before this should happen; but the fire burst out\\nagain brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about the hill among\\nthem and avoided them, looking for some trace of Weena. But Weena was\\ngone.\\n\\n“At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this\\nstrange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and\\nmaking uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat on\\nthem. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and through\\nthe rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they belonged to\\nanother universe, shone the little stars. Two or three Morlocks came\\nblundering into me, and I drove them off with blows of my fists,\\ntrembling as I did so.\\n\\n“For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare. I\\nbit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat the\\nground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and wandered here\\nand there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to rubbing my eyes and\\ncalling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw Morlocks put their heads\\ndown in a kind of agony and rush into the flames. But, at last, above\\nthe subsiding red of the fire, above the streaming masses of black\\nsmoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps, and the diminishing\\nnumbers of these dim creatures, came the white light of the day.\\n\\n“I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was\\nplain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I cannot\\ndescribe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate\\nto which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was almost moved\\nto begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me, but I\\ncontained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind of island in\\nthe forest. From its summit I could now make out through a haze of\\nsmoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that I could get my\\nbearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the remnant of these\\ndamned souls still going hither and thither and moaning, as the day\\ngrew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet and limped on across\\nsmoking ashes and among black stems that still pulsated internally with\\nfire, towards the hiding-place of the Time Machine. I walked slowly,\\nfor I was almost exhausted, as well as lame, and I felt the intensest\\nwretchedness for the horrible death of little Weena. It seemed an\\noverwhelming calamity. Now, in this old familiar room, it is more like\\nthe sorrow of a dream than an actual loss. But that morning it left me\\nabsolutely lonely again—terribly alone. I began to think of this house\\nof mine, of this fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came\\na longing that was pain.\\n\\n“But, as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky,\\nI made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose matches.\\nThe box must have leaked before it was lost.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n XIII.\\n The Trap of the White Sphinx\\n\\n\\n“About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of yellow\\nmetal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival.\\nI thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and could not\\nrefrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Here was the same\\nbeautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same splendid palaces\\nand magnificent ruins, the same silver river running between its\\nfertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and\\nthither among the trees. Some were bathing in exactly the place where I\\nhad saved Weena, and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain. And\\nlike blots upon the landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the\\nUnderworld. I understood now what all the beauty of the Overworld\\npeople covered. Very pleasant was their day, as pleasant as the day of\\nthe cattle in the field. Like the cattle, they knew of no enemies and\\nprovided against no needs. And their end was the same.\\n\\n“I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had\\nbeen. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly towards\\ncomfort and ease, a balanced society with security and permanency as\\nits watchword, it had attained its hopes—to come to this at last. Once,\\nlife and property must have reached almost absolute safety. The rich\\nhad been assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his\\nlife and work. No doubt in that perfect world there had been no\\nunemployed problem, no social question left unsolved. And a great quiet\\nhad followed.\\n\\n“It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility is\\nthe compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly\\nin harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism. Nature never\\nappeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is\\nno intelligence where there is no change and no need of change. Only\\nthose animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety\\nof needs and dangers.\\n\\n“So, as I see it, the Upperworld man had drifted towards his feeble\\nprettiness, and the Underworld to mere mechanical industry. But that\\nperfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical\\nperfection—absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, the feeding\\nof an Underworld, however it was effected, had become disjointed.\\nMother Necessity, who had been staved off for a few thousand years,\\ncame back again, and she began below. The Underworld being in contact\\nwith machinery, which, however perfect, still needs some little thought\\noutside habit, had probably retained perforce rather more initiative,\\nif less of every other human character, than the Upper. And when other\\nmeat failed them, they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden.\\nSo I say I saw it in my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two\\nThousand Seven Hundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as\\nmortal wit could invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and\\nas that I give it to you.\\n\\n“After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and in\\nspite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm\\nsunlight were very pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon my\\ntheorising passed into dozing. Catching myself at that, I took my own\\nhint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and\\nrefreshing sleep.\\n\\n“I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being\\ncaught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on down\\nthe hill towards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one hand, and\\nthe other hand played with the matches in my pocket.\\n\\n“And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal of\\nthe sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid down into\\ngrooves.\\n\\n“At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.\\n\\n“Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner of\\nthis was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket. So\\nhere, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the White\\nSphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost sorry\\nnot to use it.\\n\\n“A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal.\\nFor once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks.\\nSuppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the bronze\\nframe and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it had been\\ncarefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that the Morlocks\\nhad even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to\\ngrasp its purpose.\\n\\n“Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere touch\\nof the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The bronze\\npanels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang. I was in the\\ndark—trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I chuckled gleefully.\\n\\n“I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me.\\nVery calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on the\\nlevers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one little\\nthing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light only on the\\nbox.\\n\\n“You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were close\\nupon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at them\\nwith the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the machine.\\nThen came one hand upon me and then another. Then I had simply to fight\\nagainst their persistent fingers for my levers, and at the same time\\nfeel for the studs over which these fitted. One, indeed, they almost\\ngot away from me. As it slipped from my hand, I had to butt in the dark\\nwith my head—I could hear the Morlock’s skull ring—to recover it. It\\nwas a nearer thing than the fight in the forest, I think, this last\\nscramble.\\n\\n“But at last the lever was fixed and pulled over. The clinging hands\\nslipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes. I found\\nmyself in the same grey light and tumult I have already described.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n XIV.\\n The Further Vision\\n\\n\\n“I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with\\ntime travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the saddle,\\nbut sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite time I clung\\nto the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite unheeding how I went,\\nand when I brought myself to look at the dials again I was amazed to\\nfind where I had arrived. One dial records days, and another thousands\\nof days, another millions of days, and another thousands of millions.\\nNow, instead of reversing the levers, I had pulled them over so as to\\ngo forward with them, and when I came to look at these indicators I\\nfound that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds\\nhand of a watch—into futurity.\\n\\n“As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things.\\nThe palpitating greyness grew darker; then—though I was still\\ntravelling with prodigious velocity—the blinking succession of day and\\nnight, which was usually indicative of a slower pace, returned, and\\ngrew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much at first. The\\nalternations of night and day grew slower and slower, and so did the\\npassage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed to stretch through\\ncenturies. At last a steady twilight brooded over the earth, a twilight\\nonly broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky.\\nThe band of light that had indicated the sun had long since\\ndisappeared; for the sun had ceased to set—it simply rose and fell in\\nthe west, and grew ever broader and more red. All trace of the moon had\\nvanished. The circling of the stars, growing slower and slower, had\\ngiven place to creeping points of light. At last, some time before I\\nstopped, the sun, red and very large, halted motionless upon the\\nhorizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and now and then\\nsuffering a momentary extinction. At one time it had for a little while\\nglowed more brilliantly again, but it speedily reverted to its sullen\\nred heat. I perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting\\nthat the work of the tidal drag was done. The earth had come to rest\\nwith one face to the sun, even as in our own time the moon faces the\\nearth. Very cautiously, for I remembered my former headlong fall, I\\nbegan to reverse my motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands\\nuntil the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no\\nlonger a mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines\\nof a desolate beach grew visible.\\n\\n“I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round.\\nThe sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black, and out\\nof the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars.\\nOverhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it\\ngrew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, lay the\\nhuge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The rocks about me were of a\\nharsh reddish colour, and all the trace of life that I could see at\\nfirst was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting\\npoint on their south-eastern face. It was the same rich green that one\\nsees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves: plants which like these\\ngrow in a perpetual twilight.\\n\\n“The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away to\\nthe south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan\\nsky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was\\nstirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle\\nbreathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living.\\nAnd along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick\\nincrustation of salt—pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of\\noppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast.\\nThe sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering, and\\nfrom that I judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now.\\n\\n“Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing\\nlike a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky\\nand, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The sound of\\nits voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly\\nupon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, what\\nI had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me.\\nThen I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you\\nimagine a crab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving\\nslowly and uncertainly, its big claws swaying, its long antennæ, like\\ncarters’ whips, waving and feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at\\nyou on either side of its metallic front? Its back was corrugated and\\nornamented with ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustation blotched\\nit here and there. I could see the many palps of its complicated mouth\\nflickering and feeling as it moved.\\n\\n“As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt a\\ntickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to\\nbrush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost\\nimmediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught\\nsomething threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a\\nfrightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna of\\nanother monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes were\\nwriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with appetite, and\\nits vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime, were descending\\nupon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and I had placed a month\\nbetween myself and these monsters. But I was still on the same beach,\\nand I saw them distinctly now as soon as I stopped. Dozens of them\\nseemed to be crawling here and there, in the sombre light, among the\\nfoliated sheets of intense green.\\n\\n“I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the\\nworld. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea,\\nthe stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the\\nuniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous plants, the thin air\\nthat hurts one’s lungs: all contributed to an appalling effect. I moved\\non a hundred years, and there was the same red sun—a little larger, a\\nlittle duller—the same dying sea, the same chill air, and the same\\ncrowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and\\nthe red rocks. And in the westward sky, I saw a curved pale line like a\\nvast new moon.\\n\\n“So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a\\nthousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth’s fate,\\nwatching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in\\nthe westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At last, more\\nthan thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of the sun had\\ncome to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens. Then I\\nstopped once more, for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared,\\nand the red beach, save for its livid green liverworts and lichens,\\nseemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with white. A bitter cold\\nassailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down. To the\\nnorth-eastward, the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable\\nsky, and I could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white.\\nThere were fringes of ice along the sea margin, with drifting masses\\nfarther out; but the main expanse of that salt ocean, all bloody under\\nthe eternal sunset, was still unfrozen.\\n\\n“I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A\\ncertain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the\\nmachine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green\\nslime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A shallow\\nsandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the\\nbeach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about upon this bank,\\nbut it became motionless as I looked at it, and I judged that my eye\\nhad been deceived, and that the black object was merely a rock. The\\nstars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very\\nlittle.\\n\\n“Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had\\nchanged; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I saw this\\ngrow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this blackness\\nthat was creeping over the day, and then I realised that an eclipse was\\nbeginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was passing across the\\nsun’s disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be the moon, but there is\\nmuch to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of\\nan inner planet passing very near to the earth.\\n\\n“The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts\\nfrom the east, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in\\nnumber. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond\\nthese lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent? It would be hard to\\nconvey the stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleating of\\nsheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the\\nbackground of our lives—all that was over. As the darkness thickened,\\nthe eddying flakes grew more abundant, dancing before my eyes; and the\\ncold of the air more intense. At last, one by one, swiftly, one after\\nthe other, the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into\\nblackness. The breeze rose to a moaning wind. I saw the black central\\nshadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me. In another moment the pale\\nstars alone were visible. All else was rayless obscurity. The sky was\\nabsolutely black.\\n\\n“A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote to my\\nmarrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I shivered, and\\na deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared\\nthe edge of the sun. I got off the machine to recover myself. I felt\\ngiddy and incapable of facing the return journey. As I stood sick and\\nconfused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal—there was no\\nmistake now that it was a moving thing—against the red water of the\\nsea. It was a round thing, the size of a football perhaps, or, it may\\nbe, bigger, and tentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against\\nthe weltering blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then\\nI felt I was fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that\\nremote and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the\\nsaddle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n XV.\\n The Time Traveller’s Return\\n\\n\\n“So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon the\\nmachine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed,\\nthe sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with greater\\nfreedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed. The\\nhands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again the dim shadows\\nof houses, the evidences of decadent humanity. These, too, changed and\\npassed, and others came. Presently, when the million dial was at zero,\\nI slackened speed. I began to recognise our own pretty and familiar\\narchitecture, the thousands hand ran back to the starting-point, the\\nnight and day flapped slower and slower. Then the old walls of the\\nlaboratory came round me. Very gently, now, I slowed the mechanism\\ndown.\\n\\n“I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told you\\nthat when I set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs. Watchett\\nhad walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me, like a\\nrocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when she\\ntraversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to be the\\nexact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower end opened,\\nand she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost, and\\ndisappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered. Just\\nbefore that I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed like a\\nflash.\\n\\n“Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar\\nlaboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got off\\nthe thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several minutes\\nI trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was my old\\nworkshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept there, and\\nthe whole thing have been a dream.\\n\\n“And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east corner\\nof the laboratory. It had come to rest again in the north-west, against\\nthe wall where you saw it. That gives you the exact distance from my\\nlittle lawn to the pedestal of the White Sphinx, into which the\\nMorlocks had carried my machine.\\n\\n“For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came through\\nthe passage here, limping, because my heel was still painful, and\\nfeeling sorely begrimed. I saw the _Pall Mall Gazette_ on the table by\\nthe door. I found the date was indeed today, and looking at the\\ntimepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o’clock. I heard your voices\\nand the clatter of plates. I hesitated—I felt so sick and weak. Then I\\nsniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the door on you. You know the\\nrest. I washed, and dined, and now I am telling you the story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n XVI.\\n After the Story\\n\\n\\n“I know,” he said, after a pause, “that all this will be absolutely\\nincredible to you, but to me the one incredible thing is that I am here\\ntonight in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces and\\ntelling you these strange adventures.” He looked at the Medical Man.\\n“No. I cannot expect you to believe it. Take it as a lie—or a prophecy.\\nSay I dreamed it in the workshop. Consider I have been speculating upon\\nthe destinies of our race, until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my\\nassertion of its truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest.\\nAnd taking it as a story, what do you think of it?”\\n\\nHe took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap\\nwith it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary\\nstillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the\\ncarpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller’s face, and looked round\\nat his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of colour swam\\nbefore them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the contemplation of\\nour host. The Editor was looking hard at the end of his cigar—the\\nsixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The others, as far as I\\nremember, were motionless.\\n\\nThe Editor stood up with a sigh. “What a pity it is you’re not a writer\\nof stories!” he said, putting his hand on the Time Traveller’s\\nshoulder.\\n\\n“You don’t believe it?”\\n\\n“Well——”\\n\\n“I thought not.”\\n\\nThe Time Traveller turned to us. “Where are the matches?” he said. He\\nlit one and spoke over his pipe, puffing. “To tell you the truth... I\\nhardly believe it myself..... And yet...”\\n\\nHis eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon\\nthe little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe, and I\\nsaw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his knuckles.\\n\\nThe Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers. “The\\ngynæceum’s odd,” he said. The Psychologist leant forward to see,\\nholding out his hand for a specimen.\\n\\n“I’m hanged if it isn’t a quarter to one,” said the Journalist. “How\\nshall we get home?”\\n\\n“Plenty of cabs at the station,” said the Psychologist.\\n\\n“It’s a curious thing,” said the Medical Man; “but I certainly don’t\\nknow the natural order of these flowers. May I have them?”\\n\\nThe Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: “Certainly not.”\\n\\n“Where did you really get them?” said the Medical Man.\\n\\nThe Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who was\\ntrying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. “They were put into my\\npocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.” He stared round the room.\\n“I’m damned if it isn’t all going. This room and you and the atmosphere\\nof every day is too much for my memory. Did I ever make a Time Machine,\\nor a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all only a dream? They say life\\nis a dream, a precious poor dream at times—but I can’t stand another\\nthat won’t fit. It’s madness. And where did the dream come from? … I\\nmust look at that machine. If there is one!”\\n\\nHe caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through the\\ndoor into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering light\\nof the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and askew, a\\nthing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering quartz. Solid\\nto the touch—for I put out my hand and felt the rail of it—and with\\nbrown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of grass and moss upon\\nthe lower parts, and one rail bent awry.\\n\\nThe Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand\\nalong the damaged rail. “It’s all right now,” he said. “The story I\\ntold you was true. I’m sorry to have brought you out here in the cold.”\\nHe took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we returned to the\\nsmoking-room.\\n\\nHe came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coat.\\nThe Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation,\\ntold him he was suffering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely. I\\nremember him standing in the open doorway, bawling good-night.\\n\\nI shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a “gaudy lie.” For\\nmy own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was so\\nfantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I lay\\nawake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go next day\\nand see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the laboratory,\\nand being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him. The laboratory,\\nhowever, was empty. I stared for a minute at the Time Machine and put\\nout my hand and touched the lever. At that the squat\\nsubstantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind. Its\\ninstability startled me extremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of\\nthe childish days when I used to be forbidden to meddle. I came back\\nthrough the corridor. The Time Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He\\nwas coming from the house. He had a small camera under one arm and a\\nknapsack under the other. He laughed when he saw me, and gave me an\\nelbow to shake. “I’m frightfully busy,” said he, “with that thing in\\nthere.”\\n\\n“But is it not some hoax?” I said. “Do you really travel through time?”\\n\\n“Really and truly I do.” And he looked frankly into my eyes. He\\nhesitated. His eye wandered about the room. “I only want half an hour,”\\nhe said. “I know why you came, and it’s awfully good of you. There’s\\nsome magazines here. If you’ll stop to lunch I’ll prove you this time\\ntravelling up to the hilt, specimens and all. If you’ll forgive my\\nleaving you now?”\\n\\nI consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,\\nand he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of the\\nlaboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily paper.\\nWhat was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly I was reminded\\nby an advertisement that I had promised to meet Richardson, the\\npublisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw that I could barely\\nsave that engagement. I got up and went down the passage to tell the\\nTime Traveller.\\n\\nAs I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly\\ntruncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled\\nround me as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken\\nglass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was not there. I seemed\\nto see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black\\nand brass for a moment—a figure so transparent that the bench behind\\nwith its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm\\nvanished as I rubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a\\nsubsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A\\npane of the skylight had, apparently, just been blown in.\\n\\nI felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had\\nhappened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange\\nthing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,\\nand the man-servant appeared.\\n\\nWe looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. “Has Mr. —— gone out\\nthat way?” said I.\\n\\n“No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him\\nhere.”\\n\\nAt that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed\\non, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps\\nstill stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring\\nwith him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime.\\nThe Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows\\nnow, he has never returned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Epilogue\\n\\n\\nOne cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he\\nswept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy\\nsavages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the\\nCretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian\\nbrutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now—if I may use the\\nphrase—be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or\\nbeside the lonely saline seas of the Triassic Age. Or did he go\\nforward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still men, but\\nwith the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome problems\\nsolved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own part, cannot\\nthink that these latter days of weak experiment, fragmentary theory,\\nand mutual discord are indeed man’s culminating time! I say, for my own\\npart. He, I know—for the question had been discussed among us long\\nbefore the Time Machine was made—thought but cheerlessly of the\\nAdvancement of Mankind, and saw in the growing pile of civilisation\\nonly a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy\\nits makers in the end. If that is so, it remains for us to live as\\nthough it were not so. But to me the future is still black and blank—is\\na vast ignorance, lit at a few casual places by the memory of his\\nstory. And I have by me, for my comfort, two strange white\\nflowers—shrivelled now, and brown and flat and brittle—to witness that\\neven when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness\\nstill lived on in the heart of man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TIME MACHINE ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 35-0.txt or 35-0.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/3/35/\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\nbe renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\n\\nSection 3.

To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n'"

the darkness xiii the trap of the white sphinx xiv the further vision xv the time traveller s return xvi after the story epilogue i introduction the time traveller for so it will be convenient to speak of him was expounding a recondite matter to us his pale grey eyes shone and twinkled and his usually pale face was flushed and animated the fire burnt brightly and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses our chairs being his patents embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon and there was that luxurious after dinner atmosphere when thought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision and he put it to us in this way marking the points with a lean forefinger as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox as we thought it and his fecundity you must follow me carefully i shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted the geometry for instance they taught you at school is founded on a misconception is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon said filby an argumentative person with red hair i do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it you will soon admit as much as i need from you you know of course that a mathematical line a line of thickness nil has no real existence they taught you that neither has a mathematical plane these things are mere abstractions that is all right said the psychologist nor having only length breadth and thickness can a cube have a real existence there i object said filby of course a solid body may exist all real things so most people think but wait a moment can an instantaneous cube exist don t follow you said filby can a cube that does not last for any time at all have a real existence filby became pensive clearly the time traveller proceeded any real body must have extension in four directions it must have length breadth thickness and duration but through a natural infirmity of the flesh which i will explain to you in a moment we incline to overlook this fact there are really four dimensions three which we call the three planes of space and a fourth time there is however a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives that said a very young man making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar over the lamp that very clear indeed now it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked continued the time traveller with a slight accession of cheerfulness really this is what is meant by the fourth dimension though some people who talk about the fourth dimension do not know they mean it it is only another way of looking at time there is no difference between time and any of the three dimensions of space except that our consciousness moves along it but some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea you have all heard what they have to say about this fourth dimension i have not said the provincial mayor it is simply this that space as our mathematicians have it is spoken of as having three dimensions which one may call length breadth and thickness and is always definable by reference to three planes each at right angles to the others but some philosophical people have been asking why three dimensions particularly why not another direction at right angles to the other three and have even tried to construct a four dimensional geometry professor simon newcomb was expounding this to the new york mathematical society only a month or so ago you know how on a flat surface which has only two dimensions we can represent a figure of a three dimensional solid and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could represent one of four if they could master the perspective of the thing see i think so murmured the provincial mayor and knitting his brows he lapsed into an introspective state his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words yes i think i see it now he said after some time brightening in a quite transitory manner well i do not mind telling you i have been at work upon this geometry of four dimensions for some time some of my results are curious for instance here is a portrait of a man at eight years old another at fifteen another at seventeen another at twenty three and so on all these are evidently sections as it were three dimensional representations of his four dimensioned being which is a fixed and unalterable thing scientific people proceeded the time traveller after the pause required for the proper assimilation of this know very well that time is only a kind of space here is a popular scientific diagram a weather record this line i trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer yesterday it was so high yesterday night it fell then this morning it rose again and so gently upward to here surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of space generally recognised but certainly it traced such a line and that line therefore we must conclude was along the time dimension but said the medical man staring hard at a coal in the fire if time is really only a fourth dimension of space why is it and why has it always been regarded as something different and why cannot we move in time as we move about in the other dimensions of space the time traveller smiled are you so sure we can move freely in space right and left we can go backward and forward freely enough and men always have done so i admit we move freely in two dimensions but how about up and down gravitation limits us there not exactly said the medical man there are balloons but before the balloons save for spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of the surface man had no freedom of vertical movement still they could move a little up and down said the medical man easier far easier down than up and you cannot move at all in time you cannot get away from the present moment my dear sir that is just where you are wrong that is just where the whole world has gone wrong we are always getting away from the present moment our mental existences which are immaterial and have no dimensions are passing along the time dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave just as we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth s surface but the great difficulty is this interrupted the psychologist you can move about in all directions of space but you cannot move about in time that is the germ of my great discovery but you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in time for instance if i am recalling an incident very vividly i go back to the instant of its occurrence i become absent minded as you say i jump back for a moment of course we have no means of staying back for any length of time any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground but a civilised man is better off than the savage in this respect he can go up against gravitation in a balloon and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the time dimension or even turn about and travel the other way oh this began filby is all why not said the time traveller it s against reason said filby what reason said the time traveller you can show black is white by argument said filby but you will never convince me possibly not said the time traveller but now you begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of four dimensions long ago i had a vague inkling of a machine to travel through time exclaimed the very young man that shall travel indifferently in any direction of space and time as the driver determines filby contented himself with laughter but i have experimental verification said the time traveller it would be remarkably convenient for the historian the psychologist suggested one might travel back and verify the accepted account of the battle of hastings for instance don t you think you would attract attention said the medical man our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms one might get one s greek from the very lips of homer and plato the very young man thought in which case they would certainly plough you for the little go the german scholars have improved greek so much then there is the future said the very young man just think one might invest all one s money leave it to accumulate at interest and hurry on ahead to discover a society said i erected on a strictly communistic basis of all the wild extravagant theories began the psychologist yes so it seemed to me and so i never talked of it until experimental verification cried i you are going to verify that the experiment cried filby who was getting brain weary let s see your experiment anyhow said the psychologist though it s all humbug you know the time traveller smiled round at us then still smiling faintly and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets he walked slowly out of the room and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory the psychologist looked at us i wonder what he s got some sleight of hand trick or other said the medical man and filby tried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at burslem but before he had finished his preface the time traveller came back and filby s anecdote collapsed ii the machine the thing the time traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework scarcely larger than a small clock and very delicately made there was ivory in it and some transparent crystalline substance and now i must be explicit for this that follows unless his explanation is to be accepted is an absolutely unaccountable thing he took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room and set it in front of the fire with two legs on the hearthrug on this table he placed the mechanism then he drew up a chair and sat down the only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp the bright light of which fell upon the model there were also perhaps a dozen candles about two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces so that the room was brilliantly illuminated i sat in a low arm chair nearest the fire and i drew this forward so as to be almost between the time traveller and the fireplace filby sat behind him looking over his shoulder the medical man and the provincial mayor watched him in profile from the right the psychologist from the left the very young man stood behind the psychologist we were all on the alert it appears incredible to me that any kind of trick however subtly conceived and however adroitly done could have been played upon us under these conditions the time traveller looked at us and then at the mechanism well said the psychologist this little affair said the time traveller resting his elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus is only a model it is my plan for a machine to travel through time you will notice that it looks singularly askew and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar as though it was in some way unreal he pointed to the part with his finger also here is one little white lever and here is another the medical man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing it s beautifully made he said it took two years to make retorted the time traveller then when we had all imitated the action of the medical man he said now i want you clearly to understand that this lever being pressed over sends the machine gliding into the future and this other reverses the motion this saddle represents the seat of a time traveller presently i am going to press the lever and off the machine will go it will vanish pass into future time and disappear have a good look at the thing look at the table too and satisfy yourselves there is no trickery i don t want to waste this model and then be told i m a quack there was a minute s pause perhaps the psychologist seemed about to speak to me but changed his mind then the time traveller put forth his finger towards the lever no he said suddenly lend me your hand and turning to the psychologist he took that individual s hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger so that it was the psychologist himself who sent forth the model time machine on its interminable voyage we all saw the lever turn i am absolutely certain there was no trickery there was a breath of wind and the lamp flame jumped one of the candles on the mantel was blown out and the little machine suddenly swung round became indistinct was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory and it was gone vanished save for the lamp the table was bare everyone was silent for a minute then filby said he was damned the psychologist recovered from his stupor and suddenly looked under the table at that the time traveller laughed cheerfully well he said with a reminiscence of the psychologist then getting up he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel and with his back to us began to fill his pipe we stared at each other look here said the medical man are you in earnest about this do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time certainly said the time traveller stooping to light a spill at the fire then he turned lighting his pipe to look at the psychologist s face the psychologist to show that he was not unhinged helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut what is more i have a big machine nearly finished in there he indicated the laboratory and when that is put together i mean to have a journey on my own account you mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future said filby into the future or the past i don t for certain know which after an interval the psychologist had an inspiration it must have gone into the past if it has gone anywhere he said why said the time traveller because i presume that it has not moved in space and if it travelled into the future it would still be here all this time since it must have travelled through this time but said i if it travelled into the past it would have been visible when we came first into this room and last thursday when we were here and the thursday before that and so forth serious objections remarked the provincial mayor with an air of impartiality turning towards the time traveller not a bit said the time traveller and to the psychologist you think you can explain that it s presentation below the threshold you know diluted presentation of course said the psychologist and reassured us that s a simple point of psychology i should have thought of it it s plain enough and helps the paradox delightfully we cannot see it nor can we appreciate this machine any more than we can the spoke of a wheel spinning or a bullet flying through the air if it is travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are if it gets through a minute while we get through a second the impression it creates will of course be only one fiftieth or one hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in time that s plain enough he passed his hand through the space in which the machine had been you see he said laughing we sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so then the time traveller asked us what we thought of it all it sounds plausible enough tonight said the medical man but wait until tomorrow wait for the common sense of the morning would you like to see the time machine itself asked the time traveller and therewith taking the lamp in his hand he led the way down the long draughty corridor to his laboratory i remember vividly the flickering light his queer broad head in silhouette the dance of the shadows how we all followed him puzzled but incredulous and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes parts were of nickel parts of ivory parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of rock crystal the thing was generally complete but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of drawings and i took one up for a better look at it quartz it seemed to be look here said the medical man are you perfectly serious or is this a trick like that ghost you showed us last christmas upon that machine said the time traveller holding the lamp aloft i intend to explore time is that plain i was never more serious in my life none of us quite knew how to take it i caught filby s eye over the shoulder of the medical man and he winked at me solemnly iii the time traveller returns i think that at that time none of us quite believed in the time machine the fact is the time traveller was one of those men who are too clever to be believed you never felt that you saw all round him you always suspected some subtle reserve some ingenuity in ambush behind his lucid frankness had filby shown the model and explained the matter in the time traveller s words we should have shown him far less scepticism for we should have perceived his motives a pork butcher could understand filby but the time traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements and we distrusted him things that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands it is a mistake to do things too easily the serious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment they were somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with eggshell china so i don t think any of us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that thursday and the next though its odd potentialities ran no doubt in most of our minds its plausibility that is its practical incredibleness the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested for my own part i was particularly preoccupied with the trick of the model that i remember discussing with the medical man whom i met on friday at the linn an he said he had seen a similar thing at t bingen and laid considerable stress on the blowing out of the candle but how the trick was done he could not explain the next thursday i went again to richmond i suppose i was one of the time traveller s most constant guests and arriving late found four or five men already assembled in his drawing room the medical man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his watch in the other i looked round for the time traveller and it s half past seven now said the medical man i suppose we d better have dinner where s said i naming our host you ve just come it s rather odd he s unavoidably detained he asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he s not back says he ll explain when he comes it seems a pity to let the dinner spoil said the editor of a well known daily paper and thereupon the doctor rang the bell the psychologist was the only person besides the doctor and myself who had attended the previous dinner the other men were blank the editor aforementioned a certain journalist and another a quiet shy man with a beard whom i didn t know and who as far as my observation went never opened his mouth all the evening there was some speculation at the dinner table about the time traveller s absence and i suggested time travelling in a half jocular spirit the editor wanted that explained to him and the psychologist volunteered a wooden account of the ingenious paradox and trick we had witnessed that day week he was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise i was facing the door and saw it first hallo i said at last and the door opened wider and the time traveller stood before us i gave a cry of surprise good heavens man what s the matter cried the medical man who saw him next and the whole tableful turned towards the door he was in an amazing plight his coat was dusty and dirty and smeared with green down the sleeves his hair disordered and as it seemed to me greyer either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually faded his face was ghastly pale his chin had a brown cut on it a cut half healed his expression was haggard and drawn as by intense suffering for a moment he hesitated in the doorway as if he had been dazzled by the light then he came into the room he walked with just such a limp as i have seen in footsore tramps we stared at him in silence expecting him to speak he said not a word but came painfully to the table and made a motion towards the wine the editor filled a glass of champagne and pushed it towards him he drained it and it seemed to do him good for he looked round the table and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his face what on earth have you been up to man said the doctor the time traveller did not seem to hear don t let me disturb you he said with a certain faltering articulation i m all right he stopped held out his glass for more and took it off at a draught that s good he said his eyes grew brighter and a faint colour came into his cheeks his glance flickered over our faces with a certain dull approval and then went round the warm and comfortable room then he spoke again still as it were feeling his way among his words i m going to wash and dress and then i ll come down and explain things save me some of that mutton i m starving for a bit of meat he looked across at the editor who was a rare visitor and hoped he was all right the editor began a question tell you presently said the time traveller i m funny be all right in a minute he put down his glass and walked towards the staircase door again i remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall and standing up in my place i saw his feet as he went out he had nothing on them but a pair of tattered blood stained socks then the door closed upon him i had half a mind to follow till i remembered how he detested any fuss about himself for a minute perhaps my mind was wool gathering then remarkable behaviour of an eminent scientist i heard the editor say thinking after his wont in headlines and this brought my attention back to the bright dinner table what s the game said the journalist has he been doing the amateur cadger i don t follow i met the eye of the psychologist and read my own interpretation in his face i thought of the time traveller limping painfully upstairs i don t think anyone else had noticed his lameness the first to recover completely from this surprise was the medical man who rang the bell the time traveller hated to have servants waiting at dinner for a hot plate at that the editor turned to his knife and fork with a grunt and the silent man followed suit the dinner was resumed conversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of wonderment and then the editor got fervent in his curiosity does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing or has he his nebuchadnezzar phases he inquired i feel assured it s this business of the time machine i said and took up the psychologist s account of our previous meeting the new guests were frankly incredulous the editor raised objections what was this time travelling a man couldn t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox could he and then as the idea came home to him he resorted to caricature hadn t they any clothes brushes in the future the journalist too would not believe at any price and joined the editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole thing they were both the new kind of journalist very joyous irreverent young men our special correspondent in the day after tomorrow reports the journalist was saying or rather shouting when the time traveller came back he was dressed in ordinary evening clothes and nothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had startled me i say said the editor hilariously these chaps here say you have been travelling into the middle of next week tell us all about little rosebery will you what will you take for the lot the time traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word he smiled quietly in his old way where s my mutton he said what a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again story cried the editor story be damned said the time traveller i want something to eat i won t say a word until i get some peptone into my arteries thanks and the salt one word said i have you been time travelling yes said the time traveller with his mouth full nodding his head i d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note said the editor the time traveller pushed his glass towards the silent man and rang it with his fingernail at which the silent man who had been staring at his face started convulsively and poured him wine the rest of the dinner was uncomfortable for my own part sudden questions kept on rising to my lips and i dare say it was the same with the others the journalist tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of hettie potter the time traveller devoted his attention to his dinner and displayed the appetite of a tramp the medical man smoked a cigarette and watched the time traveller through his eyelashes the silent man seemed even more clumsy than usual and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of sheer nervousness at last the time traveller pushed his plate away and looked round us i suppose i must apologise he said i was simply starving i ve had a most amazing time he reached out his hand for a cigar and cut the end but come into the smoking room it s too long a story to tell over greasy plates and ringing the bell in passing he led the way into the adjoining room you have told blank and dash and chose about the machine he said to me leaning back in his easy chair and naming the three new guests but the thing s a mere paradox said the editor i can t argue tonight i don t mind telling you the story but i can t argue i will he went on tell you the story of what has happened to me if you like but you must refrain from interruptions i want to tell it badly most of it will sound like lying so be it it s true every word of it all the same i was in my laboratory at four o clock and since then i ve lived eight days such days as no human being ever lived before i m nearly worn out but i shan t sleep till i ve told this thing over to you then i shall go to bed but no interruptions is it agreed agreed said the editor and the rest of us echoed agreed and with that the time traveller began his story as i have set it forth he sat back in his chair at first and spoke like a weary man afterwards he got more animated in writing it down i feel with only too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink and above all my own inadequacy to express its quality you read i will suppose attentively enough but you cannot see the speaker s white sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp nor hear the intonation of his voice you cannot know how his expression followed the turns of his story most of us hearers were in shadow for the candles in the smoking room had not been lighted and only the face of the journalist and the legs of the silent man from the knees downward were illuminated at first we glanced now and again at each other after a time we ceased to do that and looked only at the time traveller s face iv time travelling i told some of you last thursday of the principles of the time machine and showed you the actual thing itself incomplete in the workshop there it is now a little travel worn truly and one of the ivory bars is cracked and a brass rail bent but the rest of it s sound enough i expected to finish it on friday but on friday when the putting together was nearly done i found that one of the nickel bars was exactly one inch too short and this i had to get remade so that the thing was not complete until this morning it was at ten o clock today that the first of all time machines began its career i gave it a last tap tried all the screws again put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod and sat myself in the saddle i suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as i felt then i took the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other pressed the first and almost immediately the second i seemed to reel i felt a nightmare sensation of falling and looking round i saw the laboratory exactly as before had anything happened for a moment i suspected that my intellect had tricked me then i noted the clock a moment before as it seemed it had stood at a minute or so past ten now it was nearly half past three i drew a breath set my teeth gripped the starting lever with both hands and went off with a thud the laboratory got hazy and went dark mrs watchett came in and walked apparently without seeing me towards the garden door i suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket i pressed the lever over to its extreme position the night came like the turning out of a lamp and in another moment came tomorrow the laboratory grew faint and hazy then fainter and ever fainter tomorrow night came black then day again night again day again faster and faster still an eddying murmur filled my ears and a strange dumb confusedness descended on my mind i am afraid i cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling they are excessively unpleasant there is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback of a helpless headlong motion i felt the same horrible anticipation too of an imminent smash as i put on pace night followed day like the flapping of a black wing the dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me and i saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky leaping it every minute and every minute marking a day i supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and i had come into the open air i had a dim impression of scaffolding but i was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things the slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me the twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye then in the intermittent darknesses i saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars presently as i went on still gaining velocity the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue a splendid luminous colour like that of early twilight the jerking sun became a streak of fire a brilliant arch in space the moon a fainter fluctuating band and i could see nothing of the stars save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue the landscape was misty and vague i was still on the hillside upon which this house now stands and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim i saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour now brown now green they grew spread shivered and passed away i saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair and pass like dreams the whole surface of the earth seemed changed melting and flowing under my eyes the little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and faster presently i noted that the sun belt swayed up and down from solstice to solstice in a minute or less and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute and minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world and vanished and was followed by the bright brief green of spring the unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now they merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration i remarked indeed a clumsy swaying of the machine for which i was unable to account but my mind was too confused to attend to it so with a kind of madness growing upon me i flung myself into futurity at first i scarce thought of stopping scarce thought of anything but these new sensations but presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread until at last they took complete possession of me what strange developments of humanity what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation i thought might not appear when i came to look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes i saw great and splendid architecture rising about me more massive than any buildings of our own time and yet as it seemed built of glimmer and mist i saw a richer green flow up the hillside and remain there without any wintry intermission even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair and so my mind came round to the business of stopping the peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in the space which i or the machine occupied so long as i travelled at a high velocity through time this scarcely mattered i was so to speak attenuated was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of intervening substances but to come to a stop involved the jamming of myself molecule by molecule into whatever lay in my way meant bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical reaction possibly a far reaching explosion would result and blow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions into the unknown this possibility had occurred to me again and again while i was making the machine but then i had cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk one of the risks a man has got to take now the risk was inevitable i no longer saw it in the same cheerful light the fact is that insensibly the absolute strangeness of everything the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine above all the feeling of prolonged falling had absolutely upset my nerves i told myself that i could never stop and with a gust of petulance i resolved to stop forthwith like an impatient fool i lugged over the lever and incontinently the thing went reeling over and i was flung headlong through the air there was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears i may have been stunned for a moment a pitiless hail was hissing round me and i was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine everything still seemed grey but presently i remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone i looked round me i was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a garden surrounded by rhododendron bushes and i noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the hailstones the rebounding dancing hail hung in a little cloud over the machine and drove along the ground like smoke in a moment i was wet to the skin fine hospitality said i to a man who has travelled innumerable years to see you presently i thought what a fool i was to get wet i stood up and looked round me a colossal figure carved apparently in some white stone loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy downpour but all else of the world was invisible my sensations would be hard to describe as the columns of hail grew thinner i saw the white figure more distinctly it was very large for a silver birch tree touched its shoulder it was of white marble in shape something like a winged sphinx but the wings instead of being carried vertically at the sides were spread so that it seemed to hover the pedestal it appeared to me was of bronze and was thick with verdigris it chanced that the face was towards me the sightless eyes seemed to watch me there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips it was greatly weather worn and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease i stood looking at it for a little space half a minute perhaps or half an hour it seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it denser or thinner at last i tore my eyes from it for a moment and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare and that the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun i looked up again at the crouching white shape and the full temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me what might appear when that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn what might not have happened to men what if cruelty had grown into a common passion what if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had developed into something inhuman unsympathetic and overwhelmingly powerful i might seem some old world savage animal only the more dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness a foul creature to be incontinently slain already i saw other vast shapes huge buildings with intricate parapets and tall columns with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon me through the lessening storm i was seized with a panic fear i turned frantically to the time machine and strove hard to readjust it as i did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm the grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a ghost above me in the intense blue of the summer sky some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness the great buildings about me stood out clear and distinct shining with the wet of the thunderstorm and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses i felt naked in a strange world i felt as perhaps a bird may feel in the clear air knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop my fear grew to frenzy i took a breathing space set my teeth and again grappled fiercely wrist and knee with the machine it gave under my desperate onset and turned over it struck my chin violently one hand on the saddle the other on the lever i stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again but with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered i looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote future in a circular opening high up in the wall of the nearer house i saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes they had seen me and their faces were directed towards me then i heard voices approaching me coming through the bushes by the white sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running one of these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which i stood with my machine he was a slight creature perhaps four feet high clad in a purple tunic girdled at the waist with a leather belt sandals or buskins i could not clearly distinguish which were on his feet his legs were bare to the knees and his head was bare noticing that i noticed for the first time how warm the air was he struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature but indescribably frail his flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much at the sight of him i suddenly regained confidence i took my hands from the machine v in the golden age in another moment we were standing face to face i and this fragile thing out of futurity he came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes the absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue there were others coming and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me one of them addressed me it came into my head oddly enough that my voice was too harsh and deep for them so i shook my head and pointing to my ears shook it again he came a step forward hesitated and then touched my hand then i felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders they wanted to make sure i was real there was nothing in this at all alarming indeed there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence a graceful gentleness a certain childlike ease and besides they looked so frail that i could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like ninepins but i made a sudden motion to warn them when i saw their little pink hands feeling at the time machine happily then when it was not too late i thought of a danger i had hitherto forgotten and reaching over the bars of the machine i unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion and put these in my pocket then i turned again to see what i could do in the way of communication and then looking more nearly into their features i saw some further peculiarities in their dresden china type of prettiness their hair which was uniformly curly came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face and their ears were singularly minute the mouths were small with bright red rather thin lips and the little chins ran to a point the eyes were large and mild and this may seem egotism on my part i fancied even that there was a certain lack of the interest i might have expected in them as they made no effort to communicate with me but simply stood round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other i began the conversation i pointed to the time machine and to myself then hesitating for a moment how to express time i pointed to the sun at once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed my gesture and then astonished me by imitating the sound of thunder for a moment i was staggered though the import of his gesture was plain enough the question had come into my mind abruptly were these creatures fools you may hardly understand how it took me you see i had always anticipated that the people of the year eight hundred and two thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge art everything then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of our five year old children asked me in fact if i had come from the sun in a thunderstorm it let loose the judgment i had suspended upon their clothes their frail light limbs and fragile features a flow of disappointment rushed across my mind for a moment i felt that i had built the time machine in vain i nodded pointed to the sun and gave them such a vivid rendering of a thunderclap as startled them they all withdrew a pace or so and bowed then came one laughing towards me carrying a chain of beautiful flowers altogether new to me and put it about my neck the idea was received with melodious applause and presently they were all running to and fro for flowers and laughingly flinging them upon me until i was almost smothered with blossom you who have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created then someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the nearest building and so i was led past the sphinx of white marble which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my astonishment towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone as i went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came with irresistible merriment to my mind the building had a huge entry and was altogether of colossal dimensions i was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of little people and with the big open portals that yawned before me shadowy and mysterious my general impression of the world i saw over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers a long neglected and yet weedless garden i saw a number of tall spikes of strange white flowers measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals they grew scattered as if wild among the variegated shrubs but as i say i did not examine them closely at this time the time machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons the arch of the doorway was richly carved but naturally i did not observe the carving very narrowly though i fancied i saw suggestions of old ph nician decorations as i passed through and it struck me that they were very badly broken and weather worn several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway and so we entered i dressed in dingy nineteenth century garments looking grotesque enough garlanded with flowers and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright soft coloured robes and shining white limbs in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech the big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with brown the roof was in shadow and the windows partially glazed with coloured glass and partially unglazed admitted a tempered light the floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal not plates nor slabs blocks and it was so much worn as i judged by the going to and fro of past generations as to be deeply channelled along the more frequented ways transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone raised perhaps a foot from the floor and upon these were heaps of fruits some i recognised as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange but for the most part they were strange between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions upon these my conductors seated themselves signing for me to do likewise with a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with their hands flinging peel and stalks and so forth into the round openings in the sides of the tables i was not loath to follow their example for i felt thirsty and hungry as i did so i surveyed the hall at my leisure and perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look the stained glass windows which displayed only a geometrical pattern were broken in many places and the curtains that hung across the lower end were thick with dust and it caught my eye that the corner of the marble table near me was fractured nevertheless the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque there were perhaps a couple of hundred people dining in the hall and most of them seated as near to me as they could come were watching me with interest their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating all were clad in the same soft and yet strong silky material fruit by the bye was all their diet these people of the remote future were strict vegetarians and while i was with them in spite of some carnal cravings i had to be frugivorous also indeed i found afterwards that horses cattle sheep dogs had followed the ichthyosaurus into extinction but the fruits were very delightful one in particular that seemed to be in season all the time i was there a floury thing in a three sided husk was especially good and i made it my staple at first i was puzzled by all these strange fruits and by the strange flowers i saw but later i began to perceive their import however i am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future now so soon as my appetite was a little checked i determined to make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine clearly that was the next thing to do the fruits seemed a convenient thing to begin upon and holding one of these up i began a series of interrogative sounds and gestures i had some considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning at first my efforts met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter but presently a fair haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name they had to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount of genuine if uncivil amusement however i felt like a schoolmaster amidst children and persisted and presently i had a score of noun substantives at least at my command and then i got to demonstrative pronouns and even the verb to eat but it was slow work and the little people soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations so i determined rather of necessity to let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined and very little doses i found they were before long for i never met people more indolent or more easily fatigued vi the sunset of mankind a queer thing i soon discovered about my little hosts and that was their lack of interest they would come to me with eager cries of astonishment like children but like children they would soon stop examining me and wander away after some other toy the dinner and my conversational beginnings ended i noted for the first time that almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone it is odd too how speedily i came to disregard these little people i went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was satisfied i was continually meeting more of these men of the future who would follow me a little distance chatter and laugh about me and having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way leave me again to my own devices the calm of evening was upon the world as i emerged from the great hall and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun at first things were very confusing everything was so entirely different from the world i had known even the flowers the big building i had left was situated on the slope of a broad river valley but the thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present position i resolved to mount to the summit of a crest perhaps a mile and a half away from which i could get a wider view of this our planet in the year eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one a d for that i should explain was the date the little dials of my machine recorded as i walked i was watching for every impression that could possibly help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which i found the world for ruinous it was a little way up the hill for instance was a great heap of granite bound together by masses of aluminium a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda like plants nettles possibly but wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves and incapable of stinging it was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure to what end built i could not determine it was here that i was destined at a later date to have a very strange experience the first intimation of a still stranger discovery but of that i will speak in its proper place looking round with a sudden thought from a terrace on which i rested for a while i realised that there were no small houses to be seen apparently the single house and possibly even the household had vanished here and there among the greenery were palace like buildings but the house and the cottage which form such characteristic features of our own english landscape had disappeared communism said i to myself and on the heels of that came another thought i looked at the half dozen little figures that were following me then in a flash i perceived that all had the same form of costume the same soft hairless visage and the same girlish rotundity of limb it may seem strange perhaps that i had not noticed this before but everything was so strange now i saw the fact plainly enough in costume and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each other these people of the future were alike and the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents i judged then that the children of that time were extremely precocious physically at least and i found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion seeing the ease and security in which these people were living i felt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would expect for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman the institution of the family and the differentiation of occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical force where population is balanced and abundant much childbearing becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the state where violence comes but rarely and offspring are secure there is less necessity indeed there is no necessity for an efficient family and the specialisation of the sexes with reference to their children s needs disappears we see some beginnings of this even in our own time and in this future age it was complete this i must remind you was my speculation at the time later i was to appreciate how far it fell short of the reality while i was musing upon these things my attention was attracted by a pretty little structure like a well under a cupola i thought in a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing and then resumed the thread of my speculations there were no large buildings towards the top of the hill and as my walking powers were evidently miraculous i was presently left alone for the first time with a strange sense of freedom and adventure i pushed on up to the crest there i found a seat of some yellow metal that i did not recognise corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in soft moss the arm rests cast and filed into the resemblance of griffins heads i sat down on it and i surveyed the broad view of our old world under the sunset of that long day it was as sweet and fair a view as i have ever seen the sun had already gone below the horizon and the west was flaming gold touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson below was the valley of the thames in which the river lay like a band of burnished steel i have already spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery some in ruins and some still occupied here and there rose a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth here and there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk there were no hedges no signs of proprietary rights no evidences of agriculture the whole earth had become a garden so watching i began to put my interpretation upon the things i had seen and as it shaped itself to me that evening my interpretation was something in this way afterwards i found i had got only a half truth or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth it seemed to me that i had happened upon humanity upon the wane the ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind for the first time i began to realise an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged and yet come to think it is a logical consequence enough strength is the outcome of need security sets a premium on feebleness the work of ameliorating the conditions of life the true civilising process that makes life more and more secure had gone steadily on to a climax one triumph of a united humanity over nature had followed another things that are now mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried forward and the harvest was what i saw after all the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still in the rudimentary stage the science of our time has attacked but a little department of the field of human disease but even so it spreads its operations very steadily and persistently our agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants leaving the greater number to fight out a balance as they can we improve our favourite plants and animals and how few they are gradually by selective breeding now a new and better peach now a seedless grape now a sweeter and larger flower now a more convenient breed of cattle we improve them gradually because our ideals are vague and tentative and our knowledge is very limited because nature too is shy and slow in our clumsy hands some day all this will be better organised and still better that is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies the whole world will be intelligent educated and co operating things will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of nature in the end wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit our human needs this adjustment i say must have been done and done well done indeed for all time in the space of time across which my machine had leapt the air was free from gnats the earth from weeds or fungi everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither the ideal of preventive medicine was attained diseases had been stamped out i saw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay and i shall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been profoundly affected by these changes social triumphs too had been effected i saw mankind housed in splendid shelters gloriously clothed and as yet i had found them engaged in no toil there were no signs of struggle neither social nor economical struggle the shop the advertisement traffic all that commerce which constitutes the body of our world was gone it was natural on that golden evening that i should jump at the idea of a social paradise the difficulty of increasing population had been met i guessed and population had ceased to increase but with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the change what unless biological science is a mass of errors is the cause of human intelligence and vigour hardship and freedom conditions under which the active strong and subtle survive and the weaker go to the wall conditions that put a premium upon the loyal alliance of capable men upon self restraint patience and decision and the institution of the family and the emotions that arise therein the fierce jealousy the tenderness for offspring parental self devotion all found their justification and support in the imminent dangers of the young now where are these imminent dangers there is a sentiment arising and it will grow against connubial jealousy against fierce maternity against passion of all sorts unnecessary things now and things that make us uncomfortable savage survivals discords in a refined and pleasant life i thought of the physical slightness of the people their lack of intelligence and those big abundant ruins and it strengthened my belief in a perfect conquest of nature for after the battle comes quiet humanity had been strong energetic and intelligent and had used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it lived and now came the reaction of the altered conditions under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security that restless energy that with us is strength would become weakness even in our own time certain tendencies and desires once necessary to survival are a constant source of failure physical courage and the love of battle for instance are no great help may even be hindrances to a civilised man and in a state of physical balance and security power intellectual as well as physical would be out of place for countless years i judged there had been no danger of war or solitary violence no danger from wild beasts no wasting disease to require strength of constitution no need of toil for such a life what we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong are indeed no longer weak better equipped indeed they are for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet no doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings i saw was the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived the flourish of that triumph which began the last great peace this has ever been the fate of energy in security it takes to art and to eroticism and then come languor and decay even this artistic impetus would at last die away had almost died in the time i saw to adorn themselves with flowers to dance to sing in the sunlight so much was left of the artistic spirit and no more even that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity we are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity and it seemed to me that here was that hateful grindstone broken at last as i stood there in the gathering dark i thought that in this simple explanation i had mastered the problem of the world mastered the whole secret of these delicious people possibly the checks they had devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well and their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary that would account for the abandoned ruins very simple was my explanation and plausible enough as most wrong theories are vii a sudden shock as i stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man the full moon yellow and gibbous came up out of an overflow of silver light in the north east the bright little figures ceased to move about below a noiseless owl flitted by and i shivered with the chill of the night i determined to descend and find where i could sleep i looked for the building i knew then my eye travelled along to the figure of the white sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze growing distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter i could see the silver birch against it there was the tangle of rhododendron bushes black in the pale light and there was the little lawn i looked at the lawn again a queer doubt chilled my complacency no said i stoutly to myself that was not the lawn but it was the lawn for the white leprous face of the sphinx was towards it can you imagine what i felt as this conviction came home to me but you cannot the time machine was gone at once like a lash across the face came the possibility of losing my own age of being left helpless in this strange new world the bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation i could feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing in another moment i was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope once i fell headlong and cut my face i lost no time in stanching the blood but jumped up and ran on with a warm trickle down my cheek and chin all the time i ran i was saying to myself they have moved it a little pushed it under the bushes out of the way nevertheless i ran with all my might all the time with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread i knew that such assurance was folly knew instinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach my breath came with pain i suppose i covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the little lawn two miles perhaps in ten minutes and i am not a young man i cursed aloud as i ran at my confident folly in leaving the machine wasting good breath thereby i cried aloud and none answered not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit world when i reached the lawn my worst fears were realised not a trace of the thing was to be seen i felt faint and cold when i faced the empty space among the black tangle of bushes i ran round it furiously as if the thing might be hidden in a corner and then stopped abruptly with my hands clutching my hair above me towered the sphinx upon the bronze pedestal white shining leprous in the light of the rising moon it seemed to smile in mockery of my dismay i might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put the mechanism in some shelter for me had i not felt assured of their physical and intellectual inadequacy that is what dismayed me the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power through whose intervention my invention had vanished yet for one thing i felt assured unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate the machine could not have moved in time the attachment of the levers i will show you the method later prevented anyone from tampering with it in that way when they were removed it had moved and was hid only in space but then where could it be i think i must have had a kind of frenzy i remember running violently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx and startling some white animal that in the dim light i took for a small deer i remember too late that night beating the bushes with my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs then sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind i went down to the great building of stone the big hall was dark silent and deserted i slipped on the uneven floor and fell over one of the malachite tables almost breaking my shin i lit a match and went on past the dusty curtains of which i have told you there i found a second great hall covered with cushions upon which perhaps a score or so of the little people were sleeping i have no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough coming suddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter and flare of a match for they had forgotten about matches where is my time machine i began bawling like an angry child laying hands upon them and shaking them up together it must have been very queer to them some laughed most of them looked sorely frightened when i saw them standing round me it came into my head that i was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the circumstances in trying to revive the sensation of fear for reasoning from their daylight behaviour i thought that fear must be forgotten abruptly i dashed down the match and knocking one of the people over in my course went blundering across the big dining hall again out under the moonlight i heard cries of terror and their little feet running and stumbling this way and that i do not remember all i did as the moon crept up the sky i suppose it was the unexpected nature of my loss that maddened me i felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind a strange animal in an unknown world i must have raved to and fro screaming and crying upon god and fate i have a memory of horrible fatigue as the long night of despair wore away of looking in this impossible place and that of groping among moonlit ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows at last of lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness even anger at the folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength i had nothing left but misery then i slept and when i woke again it was full day and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm i sat up in the freshness of the morning trying to remember how i had got there and why i had such a profound sense of desertion and despair then things came clear in my mind with the plain reasonable daylight i could look my circumstances fairly in the face i saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight and i could reason with myself suppose the worst i said suppose the machine altogether lost perhaps destroyed it behoves me to be calm and patient to learn the way of the people to get a clear idea of the method of my loss and the means of getting materials and tools so that in the end perhaps i may make another that would be my only hope a poor hope perhaps but better than despair and after all it was a beautiful and curious world but probably the machine had only been taken away still i must be calm and patient find its hiding place and recover it by force or cunning and with that i scrambled to my feet and looked about me wondering where i could bathe i felt weary stiff and travel soiled the freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness i had exhausted my emotion indeed as i went about my business i found myself wondering at my intense excitement overnight i made a careful examination of the ground about the little lawn i wasted some time in futile questionings conveyed as well as i was able to such of the little people as came by they all failed to understand my gestures some were simply stolid some thought it was a jest and laughed at me i had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces it was a foolish impulse but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity the turf gave better counsel i found a groove ripped in it about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet where on arrival i had struggled with the overturned machine there were other signs of removal about with queer narrow footprints like those i could imagine made by a sloth this directed my closer attention to the pedestal it was as i think i have said of bronze it was not a mere block but highly decorated with deep framed panels on either side i went and rapped at these the pedestal was hollow examining the panels with care i found them discontinuous with the frames there were no handles or keyholes but possibly the panels if they were doors as i supposed opened from within one thing was clear enough to my mind it took no very great mental effort to infer that my time machine was inside that pedestal but how it got there was a different problem i saw the heads of two orange clad people coming through the bushes and under some blossom covered apple trees towards me i turned smiling to them and beckoned them to me they came and then pointing to the bronze pedestal i tried to intimate my wish to open it but at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly i don t know how to convey their expression to you suppose you were to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate minded woman it is how she would look they went off as if they had received the last possible insult i tried a sweet looking little chap in white next with exactly the same result somehow his manner made me feel ashamed of myself but as you know i wanted the time machine and i tried him once more as he turned off like the others my temper got the better of me in three strides i was after him had him by the loose part of his robe round the neck and began dragging him towards the sphinx then i saw the horror and repugnance of his face and all of a sudden i let him go but i was not beaten yet i banged with my fist at the bronze panels i thought i heard something stir inside to be explicit i thought i heard a sound like a chuckle but i must have been mistaken then i got a big pebble from the river and came and hammered till i had flattened a coil in the decorations and the verdigris came off in powdery flakes the delicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand but nothing came of it i saw a crowd of them upon the slopes looking furtively at me at last hot and tired i sat down to watch the place but i was too restless to watch long i am too occidental for a long vigil i could work at a problem for years but to wait inactive for twenty four hours that is another matter i got up after a time and began walking aimlessly through the bushes towards the hill again patience said i to myself if you want your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone if they mean to take your machine away it s little good your wrecking their bronze panels and if they don t you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it to sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is hopeless that way lies monomania face this world learn its ways watch it be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning in the end you will find clues to it all then suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind the thought of the years i had spent in study and toil to get into the future age and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it i had made myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a man devised although it was at my own expense i could not help myself i laughed aloud going through the big palace it seemed to me that the little people avoided me it may have been my fancy or it may have had something to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze yet i felt tolerably sure of the avoidance i was careful however to show no concern and to abstain from any pursuit of them and in the course of a day or two things got back to the old footing i made what progress i could in the language and in addition i pushed my explorations here and there either i missed some subtle point or their language was excessively simple almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs there seemed to be few if any abstract terms or little use of figurative language their sentences were usually simple and of two words and i failed to convey or understand any but the simplest propositions i determined to put the thought of my time machine and the mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural way yet a certain feeling you may understand tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival viii explanation so far as i could see all the world displayed the same exuberant richness as the thames valley from every hill i climbed i saw the same abundance of splendid buildings endlessly varied in material and style the same clustering thickets of evergreens the same blossom laden trees and tree ferns here and there water shone like silver and beyond the land rose into blue undulating hills and so faded into the serenity of the sky a peculiar feature which presently attracted my attention was the presence of certain circular wells several as it seemed to me of a very great depth one lay by the path up the hill which i had followed during my first walk like the others it was rimmed with bronze curiously wrought and protected by a little cupola from the rain sitting by the side of these wells and peering down into the shafted darkness i could see no gleam of water nor could i start any reflection with a lighted match but in all of them i heard a certain sound a thud thud thud like the beating of some big engine and i discovered from the flaring of my matches that a steady current of air set down the shafts further i threw a scrap of paper into the throat of one and instead of fluttering slowly down it was at once sucked swiftly out of sight after a time too i came to connect these wells with tall towers standing here and there upon the slopes for above them there was often just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a sun scorched beach putting things together i reached a strong suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation whose true import it was difficult to imagine i was at first inclined to associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people it was an obvious conclusion but it was absolutely wrong and here i must admit that i learnt very little of drains and bells and modes of conveyance and the like conveniences during my time in this real future in some of these visions of utopias and coming times which i have read there is a vast amount of detail about building and social arrangements and so forth but while such details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is contained in one s imagination they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid such realities as i found here conceive the tale of london which a negro fresh from central africa would take back to his tribe what would he know of railway companies of social movements of telephone and telegraph wires of the parcels delivery company and postal orders and the like yet we at least should be willing enough to explain these things to him and even of what he knew how much could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe then think how narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times and how wide the interval between myself and these of the golden age i was sensible of much which was unseen and which contributed to my comfort but save for a general impression of automatic organisation i fear i can convey very little of the difference to your mind in the matter of sepulture for instance i could see no signs of crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs but it occurred to me that possibly there might be cemeteries or crematoria somewhere beyond the range of my explorings this again was a question i deliberately put to myself and my curiosity was at first entirely defeated upon the point the thing puzzled me and i was led to make a further remark which puzzled me still more that aged and infirm among this people there were none i must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an automatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure yet i could think of no other let me put my difficulties the several big palaces i had explored were mere living places great dining halls and sleeping apartments i could find no machinery no appliances of any kind yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at times need renewal and their sandals though undecorated were fairly complex specimens of metalwork somehow such things must be made and the little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency there were no shops no workshops no sign of importations among them they spent all their time in playing gently in bathing in the river in making love in a half playful fashion in eating fruit and sleeping i could not see how things were kept going then again about the time machine something i knew not what had taken it into the hollow pedestal of the white sphinx why for the life of me i could not imagine those waterless wells too those flickering pillars i felt i lacked a clue i felt how shall i put it suppose you found an inscription with sentences here and there in excellent plain english and interpolated therewith others made up of words of letters even absolutely unknown to you well on the third day of my visit that was how the world of eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one presented itself to me that day too i made a friend of a sort it happened that as i was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow one of them was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream the main current ran rather swiftly but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer it will give you an idea therefore of the strange deficiency in these creatures when i tell you that none made the slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes when i realised this i hurriedly slipped off my clothes and wading in at a point lower down i caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land a little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round and i had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before i left her i had got to such a low estimate of her kind that i did not expect any gratitude from her in that however i was wrong this happened in the morning in the afternoon i met my little woman as i believe it was as i was returning towards my centre from an exploration and she received me with cries of delight and presented me with a big garland of flowers evidently made for me and me alone the thing took my imagination very possibly i had been feeling desolate at any rate i did my best to display my appreciation of the gift we were soon seated together in a little stone arbour engaged in conversation chiefly of smiles the creature s friendliness affected me exactly as a child s might have done we passed each other flowers and she kissed my hands i did the same to hers then i tried talk and found that her name was weena which though i don t know what it meant somehow seemed appropriate enough that was the beginning of a queer friendship which lasted a week and ended as i will tell you she was exactly like a child she wanted to be with me always she tried to follow me everywhere and on my next journey out and about it went to my heart to tire her down and leave her at last exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively but the problems of the world had to be mastered i had not i said to myself come into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation yet her distress when i left her was very great her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic and i think altogether i had as much trouble as comfort from her devotion nevertheless she was somehow a very great comfort i thought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me until it was too late i did not clearly know what i had inflicted upon her when i left her nor until it was too late did i clearly understand what she was to me for by merely seeming fond of me and showing in her weak futile way that she cared for me the little doll of a creature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the white sphinx almost the feeling of coming home and i would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold so soon as i came over the hill it was from her too that i learnt that fear had not yet left the world she was fearless enough in the daylight and she had the oddest confidence in me for once in a foolish moment i made threatening grimaces at her and she simply laughed at them but she dreaded the dark dreaded shadows dreaded black things darkness to her was the one thing dreadful it was a singularly passionate emotion and it set me thinking and observing i discovered then among other things that these little people gathered into the great houses after dark and slept in droves to enter upon them without a light was to put them into a tumult of apprehension i never found one out of doors or one sleeping alone within doors after dark yet i was still such a blockhead that i missed the lesson of that fear and in spite of weena s distress i insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering multitudes it troubled her greatly but in the end her odd affection for me triumphed and for five of the nights of our acquaintance including the last night of all she slept with her head pillowed on my arm but my story slips away from me as i speak of her it must have been the night before her rescue that i was awakened about dawn i had been restless dreaming most disagreeably that i was drowned and that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps i woke with a start and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed out of the chamber i tried to get to sleep again but i felt restless and uncomfortable it was that dim grey hour when things are just creeping out of darkness when everything is colourless and clear cut and yet unreal i got up and went down into the great hall and so out upon the flagstones in front of the palace i thought i would make a virtue of necessity and see the sunrise the moon was setting and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of dawn were mingled in a ghastly half light the bushes were inky black the ground a sombre grey the sky colourless and cheerless and up the hill i thought i could see ghosts three several times as i scanned the slope i saw white figures twice i fancied i saw a solitary white ape like creature running rather quickly up the hill and once near the ruins i saw a leash of them carrying some dark body they moved hastily i did not see what became of them it seemed that they vanished among the bushes the dawn was still indistinct you must understand i was feeling that chill uncertain early morning feeling you may have known i doubted my eyes as the eastern sky grew brighter and the light of the day came on and its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more i scanned the view keenly but i saw no vestige of my white figures they were mere creatures of the half light they must have been ghosts i said i wonder whence they dated for a queer notion of grant allen s came into my head and amused me if each generation die and leave ghosts he argued the world at last will get overcrowded with them on that theory they would have grown innumerable some eight hundred thousand years hence and it was no great wonder to see four at once but the jest was unsatisfying and i was thinking of these figures all the morning until weena s rescue drove them out of my head i associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal i had startled in my first passionate search for the time machine but weena was a pleasant substitute yet all the same they were soon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind i think i have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of this golden age i cannot account for it it may be that the sun was hotter or the earth nearer the sun it is usual to assume that the sun will go on cooling steadily in the future but people unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger darwin forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body as these catastrophes occur the sun will blaze with renewed energy and it may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate whatever the reason the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know it well one very hot morning my fourth i think as i was seeking shelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where i slept and fed there happened this strange thing clambering among these heaps of masonry i found a narrow gallery whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone by contrast with the brilliancy outside it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me i entered it groping for the change from light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me suddenly i halted spellbound a pair of eyes luminous by reflection against the daylight without was watching me out of the darkness the old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me i clenched my hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs i was afraid to turn then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living came to my mind and then i remembered that strange terror of the dark overcoming my fear to some extent i advanced a step and spoke i will admit that my voice was harsh and ill controlled i put out my hand and touched something soft at once the eyes darted sideways and something white ran past me i turned with my heart in my mouth and saw a queer little ape like figure its head held down in a peculiar manner running across the sunlit space behind me it blundered against a block of granite staggered aside and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry my impression of it is of course imperfect but i know it was a dull white and had strange large greyish red eyes also that there was flaxen hair on its head and down its back but as i say it went too fast for me to see distinctly i cannot even say whether it ran on all fours or only with its forearms held very low after an instant s pause i followed it into the second heap of ruins i could not find it at first but after a time in the profound obscurity i came upon one of those round well like openings of which i have told you half closed by a fallen pillar a sudden thought came to me could this thing have vanished down the shaft i lit a match and looking down i saw a small white moving creature with large bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated it made me shudder it was so like a human spider it was clambering down the wall and now i saw for the first time a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand going out as it dropped and when i had lit another the little monster had disappeared i do not know how long i sat peering down that well it was not for some time that i could succeed in persuading myself that the thing i had seen was human but gradually the truth dawned on me that man had not remained one species but had differentiated into two distinct animals that my graceful children of the upper world were not the sole descendants of our generation but that this bleached obscene nocturnal thing which had flashed before me was also heir to all the ages i thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground ventilation i began to suspect their true import and what i wondered was this lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced organisation how was it related to the indolent serenity of the beautiful overworlders and what was hidden down there at the foot of that shaft i sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that at any rate there was nothing to fear and that there i must descend for the solution of my difficulties and withal i was absolutely afraid to go as i hesitated two of the beautiful upperworld people came running in their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow the male pursued the female flinging flowers at her as he ran they seemed distressed to find me my arm against the overturned pillar peering down the well apparently it was considered bad form to remark these apertures for when i pointed to this one and tried to frame a question about it in their tongue they were still more visibly distressed and turned away but they were interested by my matches and i struck some to amuse them i tried them again about the well and again i failed so presently i left them meaning to go back to weena and see what i could get from her but my mind was already in revolution my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a new adjustment i had now a clue to the import of these wells to the ventilating towers to the mystery of the ghosts to say nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the time machine and very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me here was the new view plainly this second species of man was subterranean there were three circumstances in particular which made me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a long continued underground habit in the first place there was the bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark the white fish of the kentucky caves for instance then those large eyes with that capacity for reflecting light are common features of nocturnal things witness the owl and the cat and last of all that evident confusion in the sunshine that hasty yet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow and that peculiar carriage of the head while in the light all reinforced the theory of an extreme sensitiveness of the retina beneath my feet then the earth must be tunnelled enormously and these tunnellings were the habitat of the new race the presence of ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes everywhere in fact except along the river valley showed how universal were its ramifications what so natural then as to assume that it was in this artificial underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of the daylight race was done the notion was so plausible that i at once accepted it and went on to assume the how of this splitting of the human species i dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory though for myself i very soon felt that it fell far short of the truth at first proceeding from the problems of our own age it seemed clear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely temporary and social difference between the capitalist and the labourer was the key to the whole position no doubt it will seem grotesque enough to you and wildly incredible and yet even now there are existing circumstances to point that way there is a tendency to utilise underground space for the less ornamental purposes of civilisation there is the metropolitan railway in london for instance there are new electric railways there are subways there are underground workrooms and restaurants and they increase and multiply evidently i thought this tendency had increased till industry had gradually lost its birthright in the sky i mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories spending a still increasing amount of its time therein till in the end even now does not an east end worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the earth again the exclusive tendency of richer people due no doubt to the increasing refinement of their education and the widening gulf between them and the rude violence of the poor is already leading to the closing in their interest of considerable portions of the surface of the land about london for instance perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against intrusion and this same widening gulf which is due to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the part of the rich will make that exchange between class and class that promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines of social stratification less and less frequent so in the end above ground you must have the haves pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty and below ground the have nots the workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of their labour once they were there they would no doubt have to pay rent and not a little of it for the ventilation of their caverns and if they refused they would starve or be suffocated for arrears such of them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die and in the end the balance being permanent the survivors would become as well adapted to the conditions of underground life and as happy in their way as the overworld people were to theirs as it seemed to me the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally enough the great triumph of humanity i had dreamed of took a different shape in my mind it had been no such triumph of moral education and general co operation as i had imagined instead i saw a real aristocracy armed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the industrial system of today its triumph had not been simply a triumph over nature but a triumph over nature and the fellow man this i must warn you was my theory at the time i had no convenient cicerone in the pattern of the utopian books my explanation may be absolutely wrong i still think it is the most plausible one but even on this supposition the balanced civilisation that was at last attained must have long since passed its zenith and was now far fallen into decay the too perfect security of the overworlders had led them to a slow movement of degeneration to a general dwindling in size strength and intelligence that i could see clearly enough already what had happened to the undergrounders i did not yet suspect but from what i had seen of the morlocks that by the bye was the name by which these creatures were called i could imagine that the modification of the human type was even far more profound than among the eloi the beautiful race that i already knew then came troublesome doubts why had the morlocks taken my time machine for i felt sure it was they who had taken it why too if the eloi were masters could they not restore the machine to me and why were they so terribly afraid of the dark i proceeded as i have said to question weena about this underworld but here again i was disappointed at first she would not understand my questions and presently she refused to answer them she shivered as though the topic was unendurable and when i pressed her perhaps a little harshly she burst into tears they were the only tears except my own i ever saw in that golden age when i saw them i ceased abruptly to trouble about the morlocks and was only concerned in banishing these signs of her human inheritance from weena s eyes and very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands while i solemnly burnt a match ix the morlocks it may seem odd to you but it was two days before i could follow up the new found clue in what was manifestly the proper way i felt a peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies they were just the half bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in spirit in a zoological museum and they were filthily cold to the touch probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the eloi whose disgust of the morlocks i now began to appreciate the next night i did not sleep well probably my health was a little disordered i was oppressed with perplexity and doubt once or twice i had a feeling of intense fear for which i could perceive no definite reason i remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight that night weena was among them and feeling reassured by their presence it occurred to me even then that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its last quarter and the nights grow dark when the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below these whitened lemurs this new vermin that had replaced the old might be more abundant and on both these days i had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty i felt assured that the time machine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these mysteries of underground yet i could not face the mystery if only i had had a companion it would have been different but i was so horribly alone and even to clamber down into the darkness of the well appalled me i don t know if you will understand my feeling but i never felt quite safe at my back it was this restlessness this insecurity perhaps that drove me farther and farther afield in my exploring expeditions going to the south westward towards the rising country that is now called combe wood i observed far off in the direction of nineteenth century banstead a vast green structure different in character from any i had hitherto seen it was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins i knew and the fa ade had an oriental look the face of it having the lustre as well as the pale green tint a kind of bluish green of a certain type of chinese porcelain this difference in aspect suggested a difference in use and i was minded to push on and explore but the day was growing late and i had come upon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit so i resolved to hold over the adventure for the following day and i returned to the welcome and the caresses of little weena but next morning i perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the palace of green porcelain was a piece of self deception to enable me to shirk by another day an experience i dreaded i resolved i would make the descent without further waste of time and started out in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite and aluminium little weena ran with me she danced beside me to the well but when she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward she seemed strangely disconcerted good bye little weena i said kissing her and then putting her down i began to feel over the parapet for the climbing hooks rather hastily i may as well confess for i feared my courage might leak away at first she watched me in amazement then she gave a most piteous cry and running to me she began to pull at me with her little hands i think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed i shook her off perhaps a little roughly and in another moment i was in the throat of the well i saw her agonised face over the parapet and smiled to reassure her then i had to look down at the unstable hooks to which i clung i had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards the descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides of the well and these being adapted to the needs of a creature much smaller and lighter than myself i was speedily cramped and fatigued by the descent and not simply fatigued one of the bars bent suddenly under my weight and almost swung me off into the blackness beneath for a moment i hung by one hand and after that experience i did not dare to rest again though my arms and back were presently acutely painful i went on clambering down the sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible glancing upward i saw the aperture a small blue disc in which a star was visible while little weena s head showed as a round black projection the thudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive everything save that little disc above was profoundly dark and when i looked up again weena had disappeared i was in an agony of discomfort i had some thought of trying to go up the shaft again and leave the underworld alone but even while i turned this over in my mind i continued to descend at last with intense relief i saw dimly coming up a foot to the right of me a slender loophole in the wall swinging myself in i found it was the aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which i could lie down and rest it was not too soon my arms ached my back was cramped and i was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall besides this the unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes the air was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft i do not know how long i lay i was arroused by a soft hand touching my face starting up in the darkness i snatched at my matches and hastily striking one i saw three stooping white creatures similar to the one i had seen above ground in the ruin hastily retreating before the light living as they did in what appeared to me impenetrable darkness their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes and they reflected the light in the same way i have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light but so soon as i struck a match in order to see them they fled incontinently vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion i tried to call to them but the language they had was apparently different from that of the overworld people so that i was needs left to my own unaided efforts and the thought of flight before exploration was even then in my mind but i said to myself you are in for it now and feeling my way along the tunnel i found the noise of machinery grow louder presently the walls fell away from me and i came to a large open space and striking another match saw that i had entered a vast arched cavern which stretched into utter darkness beyond the range of my light the view i had of it was as much as one could see in the burning of a match necessarily my memory is vague great shapes like big machines rose out of the dimness and cast grotesque black shadows in which dim spectral morlocks sheltered from the glare the place by the bye was very stuffy and oppressive and the faint halitus of freshly shed blood was in the air some way down the central vista was a little table of white metal laid with what seemed a meal the morlocks at any rate were carnivorous even at the time i remember wondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red joint i saw it was all very indistinct the heavy smell the big unmeaning shapes the obscene figures lurking in the shadows and only waiting for the darkness to come at me again then the match burnt down and stung my fingers and fell a wriggling red spot in the blackness i have thought since how particularly ill equipped i was for such an experience when i had started with the time machine i had started with the absurd assumption that the men of the future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances i had come without arms without medicine without anything to smoke at times i missed tobacco frightfully even without enough matches if only i had thought of a kodak i could have flashed that glimpse of the underworld in a second and examined it at leisure but as it was i stood there with only the weapons and the powers that nature had endowed me with hands feet and teeth these and four safety matches that still remained to me i was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark and it was only with my last glimpse of light i discovered that my store of matches had run low it had never occurred to me until that moment that there was any need to economise them and i had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the overworlders to whom fire was a novelty now as i say i had four left and while i stood in the dark a hand touched mine lank fingers came feeling over my face and i was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour i fancied i heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me i felt the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing the sense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably unpleasant the sudden realisation of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness i shouted at them as loudly as i could they started away and then i could feel them approaching me again they clutched at me more boldly whispering odd sounds to each other i shivered violently and shouted again rather discordantly this time they were not so seriously alarmed and they made a queer laughing noise as they came back at me i will confess i was horribly frightened i determined to strike another match and escape under the protection of its glare i did so and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper from my pocket i made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel but i had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the blackness i could hear the morlocks rustling like wind among leaves and pattering like the rain as they hurried after me in a moment i was clutched by several hands and there was no mistaking that they were trying to haul me back i struck another light and waved it in their dazzled faces you can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked those pale chinless faces and great lidless pinkish grey eyes as they stared in their blindness and bewilderment but i did not stay to look i promise you i retreated again and when my second match had ended i struck my third it had almost burnt through when i reached the opening into the shaft i lay down on the edge for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy then i felt sideways for the projecting hooks and as i did so my feet were grasped from behind and i was violently tugged backward i lit my last match and it incontinently went out but i had my hand on the climbing bars now and kicking violently i disengaged myself from the clutches of the morlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft while they stayed peering and blinking up at me all but one little wretch who followed me for some way and well nigh secured my boot as a trophy that climb seemed interminable to me with the last twenty or thirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me i had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold the last few yards was a frightful struggle against this faintness several times my head swam and i felt all the sensations of falling at last however i got over the well mouth somehow and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight i fell upon my face even the soil smelt sweet and clean then i remember weena kissing my hands and ears and the voices of others among the eloi then for a time i was insensible x when night came now indeed i seemed in a worse case than before hitherto except during my night s anguish at the loss of the time machine i had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape but that hope was staggered by these new discoveries hitherto i had merely thought myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people and by some unknown forces which i had only to understand to overcome but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of the morlocks a something inhuman and malign instinctively i loathed them before i had felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it now i felt like a beast in a trap whose enemy would come upon him soon the enemy i dreaded may surprise you it was the darkness of the new moon weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible remarks about the dark nights it was not now such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming dark nights might mean the moon was on the wane each night there was a longer interval of darkness and i now understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear of the little upperworld people for the dark i wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that the morlocks did under the new moon i felt pretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong the upperworld people might once have been the favoured aristocracy and the morlocks their mechanical servants but that had long since passed away the two species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down towards or had already arrived at an altogether new relationship the eloi like the carlovignan kings had decayed to a mere beautiful futility they still possessed the earth on sufferance since the morlocks subterranean for innumerable generations had come at last to find the daylit surface intolerable and the morlocks made their garments i inferred and maintained them in their habitual needs perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service they did it as a standing horse paws with his foot or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the organism but clearly the old order was already in part reversed the nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace ages ago thousands of generations ago man had thrust his brother man out of the ease and the sunshine and now that brother was coming back changed already the eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew they were becoming reacquainted with fear and suddenly there came into my head the memory of the meat i had seen in the underworld it seemed odd how it floated into my mind not stirred up as it were by the current of my meditations but coming in almost like a question from outside i tried to recall the form of it i had a vague sense of something familiar but i could not tell what it was at the time still however helpless the little people in the presence of their mysterious fear i was differently constituted i came out of this age of ours this ripe prime of the human race when fear does not paralyse and mystery has lost its terrors i at least would defend myself without further delay i determined to make myself arms and a fastness where i might sleep with that refuge as a base i could face this strange world with some of that confidence i had lost in realising to what creatures night by night i lay exposed i felt i could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them i shuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined me i wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the thames but found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible all the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers as the morlocks to judge by their wells must be then the tall pinnacles of the palace of green porcelain and the polished gleam of its walls came back to my memory and in the evening taking weena like a child upon my shoulder i went up the hills towards the south west the distance i had reckoned was seven or eight miles but it must have been nearer eighteen i had first seen the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished in addition the heel of one of my shoes was loose and a nail was working through the sole they were comfortable old shoes i wore about indoors so that i was lame and it was already long past sunset when i came in sight of the palace silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky weena had been hugely delighted when i began to carry her but after a while she desired me to let her down and ran along by the side of me occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my pockets my pockets had always puzzled weena but at the last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases for floral decoration at least she utilised them for that purpose and that reminds me in changing my jacket i found the time traveller paused put his hand into his pocket and silently placed two withered flowers not unlike very large white mallows upon the little table then he resumed his narrative as the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the hill crest towards wimbledon weena grew tired and wanted to return to the house of grey stone but i pointed out the distant pinnacles of the palace of green porcelain to her and contrived to make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her fear you know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk even the breeze stops in the trees to me there is always an air of expectation about that evening stillness the sky was clear remote and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the sunset well that night the expectation took the colour of my fears in that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally sharpened i fancied i could even feel the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet could indeed almost see through it the morlocks on their ant hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark in my excitement i fancied that they would receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war and why had they taken my time machine so we went on in the quiet and the twilight deepened into night the clear blue of the distance faded and one star after another came out the ground grew dim and the trees black weena s fears and her fatigue grew upon her i took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed her then as the darkness grew deeper she put her arms round my neck and closing her eyes tightly pressed her face against my shoulder so we went down a long slope into a valley and there in the dimness i almost walked into a little river this i waded and went up the opposite side of the valley past a number of sleeping houses and by a statue a faun or some such figure minus the head here too were acacias so far i had seen nothing of the morlocks but it was yet early in the night and the darker hours before the old moon rose were still to come from the brow of the next hill i saw a thick wood spreading wide and black before me i hesitated at this i could see no end to it either to the right or the left feeling tired my feet in particular were very sore i carefully lowered weena from my shoulder as i halted and sat down upon the turf i could no longer see the palace of green porcelain and i was in doubt of my direction i looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide under that dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars even were there no other lurking danger a danger i did not care to let my imagination loose upon there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the tree boles to strike against i was very tired too after the excitements of the day so i decided that i would not face it but would pass the night upon the open hill weena i was glad to find was fast asleep i carefully wrapped her in my jacket and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise the hillside was quiet and deserted but from the black of the wood there came now and then a stir of living things above me shone the stars for the night was very clear i felt a certain sense of friendly comfort in their twinkling all the old constellations had gone from the sky however that slow movement which is imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings but the milky way it seemed to me was still the same tattered streamer of star dust as of yore southward as i judged it was a very bright red star that was new to me it was even more splendid than our own green sirius and amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the gravities of terrestrial life i thought of their unfathomable distance and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the unknown past into the unknown future i thought of the great precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes only forty times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that i had traversed and during these few revolutions all the activity all the traditions the complex organisations the nations languages literatures aspirations even the mere memory of man as i knew him had been swept out of existence instead were these frail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry and the white things of which i went in terror then i thought of the great fear that was between the two species and for the first time with a sudden shiver came the clear knowledge of what the meat i had seen might be yet it was too horrible i looked at little weena sleeping beside me her face white and starlike under the stars and forthwith dismissed the thought through that long night i held my mind off the morlocks as well as i could and whiled away the time by trying to fancy i could find signs of the old constellations in the new confusion the sky kept very clear except for a hazy cloud or so no doubt i dozed at times then as my vigil wore on came a faintness in the eastward sky like the reflection of some colourless fire and the old moon rose thin and peaked and white and close behind and overtaking it and overflowing it the dawn came pale at first and then growing pink and warm no morlocks had approached us indeed i had seen none upon the hill that night and in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable i stood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel so i sat down again took off my shoes and flung them away i awakened weena and we went down into the wood now green and pleasant instead of black and forbidding we found some fruit wherewith to break our fast we soon met others of the dainty ones laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as the night and then i thought once more of the meat that i had seen i felt assured now of what it was and from the bottom of my heart i pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity clearly at some time in the long ago of human decay the morlocks food had run short possibly they had lived on rats and such like vermin even now man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he was far less than any monkey his prejudice against human flesh is no deep seated instinct and so these inhuman sons of men i tried to look at the thing in a scientific spirit after all they were less human and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago and the intelligence that would have made this state of things a torment had gone why should i trouble myself these eloi were mere fatted cattle which the ant like morlocks preserved and preyed upon probably saw to the breeding of and there was weena dancing at my side then i tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon me by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness man had been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his fellow man had taken necessity as his watchword and excuse and in the fullness of time necessity had come home to him i even tried a carlyle like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay but this attitude of mind was impossible however great their intellectual degradation the eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim my sympathy and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and their fear i had at that time very vague ideas as to the course i should pursue my first was to secure some safe place of refuge and to make myself such arms of metal or stone as i could contrive that necessity was immediate in the next place i hoped to procure some means of fire so that i should have the weapon of a torch at hand for nothing i knew would be more efficient against these morlocks then i wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the white sphinx i had in mind a battering ram i had a persuasion that if i could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me i should discover the time machine and escape i could not imagine the morlocks were strong enough to move it far away weena i had resolved to bring with me to our own time and turning such schemes over in my mind i pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling xi the palace of green porcelain i found the palace of green porcelain when we approached it about noon deserted and falling into ruin only ragged vestiges of glass remained in its windows and great sheets of the green facing had fallen away from the corroded metallic framework it lay very high upon a turfy down and looking north eastward before i entered it i was surprised to see a large estuary or even creek where i judged wandsworth and battersea must once have been i thought then though i never followed up the thought of what might have happened or might be happening to the living things in the sea the material of the palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain and along the face of it i saw an inscription in some unknown character i thought rather foolishly that weena might help me to interpret this but i only learnt that the bare idea of writing had never entered her head she always seemed to me i fancy more human than she was perhaps because her affection was so human within the big valves of the door which were open and broken we found instead of the customary hall a long gallery lit by many side windows at the first glance i was reminded of a museum the tiled floor was thick with dust and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering then i perceived standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall what was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton i recognised by the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the fashion of the megatherium the skull and the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust and in one place where rain water had dropped through a leak in the roof the thing itself had been worn away further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a brontosaurus my museum hypothesis was confirmed going towards the side i found what appeared to be sloping shelves and clearing away the thick dust i found the old familiar glass cases of our own time but they must have been air tight to judge from the fair preservation of some of their contents clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter day south kensington here apparently was the pal ontological section and a very splendid array of fossils it must have been though the inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time and had through the extinction of bacteria and fungi lost ninety nine hundredths of its force was nevertheless with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures here and there i found traces of the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds and the cases had in some instances been bodily removed by the morlocks as i judged the place was very silent the thick dust deadened our footsteps weena who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case presently came as i stared about me and very quietly took my hand and stood beside me and at first i was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an intellectual age that i gave no thought to the possibilities it presented even my preoccupation about the time machine receded a little from my mind to judge from the size of the place this palace of green porcelain had a great deal more in it than a gallery of pal ontology possibly historical galleries it might be even a library to me at least in my present circumstances these would be vastly more interesting than this spectacle of old time geology in decay exploring i found another short gallery running transversely to the first this appeared to be devoted to minerals and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder but i could find no saltpetre indeed no nitrates of any kind doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago yet the sulphur hung in my mind and set up a train of thinking as for the rest of the contents of that gallery though on the whole they were the best preserved of all i saw i had little interest i am no specialist in mineralogy and i went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall i had entered apparently this section had been devoted to natural history but everything had long since passed out of recognition a few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed animals desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit a brown dust of departed plants that was all i was sorry for that because i should have been glad to trace the patient readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been attained then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions but singularly ill lit the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the end at which i entered at intervals white globes hung from the ceiling many of them cracked and smashed which suggested that originally the place had been artificially lit here i was more in my element for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big machines all greatly corroded and many broken down but some still fairly complete you know i have a certain weakness for mechanism and i was inclined to linger among these the more so as for the most part they had the interest of puzzles and i could make only the vaguest guesses at what they were for i fancied that if i could solve their puzzles i should find myself in possession of powers that might be of use against the morlocks suddenly weena came very close to my side so suddenly that she startled me had it not been for her i do not think i should have noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all footnote it may be of course that the floor did not slope but that the museum was built into the side of a hill ed the end i had come in at was quite above ground and was lit by rare slit like windows as you went down the length the ground came up against these windows until at last there was a pit like the area of a london house before each and only a narrow line of daylight at the top i went slowly along puzzling about the machines and had been too intent upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light until weena s increasing apprehensions drew my attention then i saw that the gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness i hesitated and then as i looked round me i saw that the dust was less abundant and its surface less even further away towards the dimness it appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints my sense of the immediate presence of the morlocks revived at that i felt that i was wasting my time in the academic examination of machinery i called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon and that i had still no weapon no refuge and no means of making a fire and then down in the remote blackness of the gallery i heard a peculiar pattering and the same odd noises i had heard down the well i took weena s hand then struck with a sudden idea i left her and turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a signal box clambering upon the stand and grasping this lever in my hands i put all my weight upon it sideways suddenly weena deserted in the central aisle began to whimper i had judged the strength of the lever pretty correctly for it snapped after a minute s strain and i rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient i judged for any morlock skull i might encounter and i longed very much to kill a morlock or so very inhuman you may think to want to go killing one s own descendants but it was impossible somehow to feel any humanity in the things only my disinclination to leave weena and a persuasion that if i began to slake my thirst for murder my time machine might suffer restrained me from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes i heard well mace in one hand and weena in the other i went out of that gallery and into another and still larger one which at the first glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags the brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it i presently recognised as the decaying vestiges of books they had long since dropped to pieces and every semblance of print had left them but here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the tale well enough had i been a literary man i might perhaps have moralised upon the futility of all ambition but as it was the thing that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified at the time i will confess that i thought chiefly of the philosophical transactions and my own seventeen papers upon physical optics then going up a broad staircase we came to what may once have been a gallery of technical chemistry and here i had not a little hope of useful discoveries except at one end where the roof had collapsed this gallery was well preserved i went eagerly to every unbroken case and at last in one of the really air tight cases i found a box of matches very eagerly i tried them they were perfectly good they were not even damp i turned to weena dance i cried to her in her own tongue for now i had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared and so in that derelict museum upon the thick soft carpeting of dust to weena s huge delight i solemnly performed a kind of composite dance whistling the land of the leal as cheerfully as i could in part it was a modest cancan in part a step dance in part a skirt dance so far as my tail coat permitted and in part original for i am naturally inventive as you know now i still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange as for me it was a most fortunate thing yet oddly enough i found a far unlikelier substance and that was camphor i found it in a sealed jar that by chance i suppose had been really hermetically sealed i fancied at first that it was paraffin wax and smashed the glass accordingly but the odour of camphor was unmistakable in the universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive perhaps through many thousands of centuries it reminded me of a sepia painting i had once seen done from the ink of a fossil belemnite that must have perished and become fossilised millions of years ago i was about to throw it away but i remembered that it was inflammable and burnt with a good bright flame was in fact an excellent candle and i put it in my pocket i found no explosives however nor any means of breaking down the bronze doors as yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing i had chanced upon nevertheless i left that gallery greatly elated i cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon it would require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all the proper order i remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms and how i hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword i could not carry both however and my bar of iron promised best against the bronze gates there were numbers of guns pistols and rifles the most were masses of rust but many were of some new metal and still fairly sound but any cartridges or powder there may once have been had rotted into dust one corner i saw was charred and shattered perhaps i thought by an explosion among the specimens in another place was a vast array of idols polynesian mexican grecian ph nician every country on earth i should think and here yielding to an irresistible impulse i wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from south america that particularly took my fancy as the evening drew on my interest waned i went through gallery after gallery dusty silent often ruinous the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of rust and lignite sometimes fresher in one place i suddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine and then by the merest accident i discovered in an air tight case two dynamite cartridges i shouted eureka and smashed the case with joy then came a doubt i hesitated then selecting a little side gallery i made my essay i never felt such a disappointment as i did in waiting five ten fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came of course the things were dummies as i might have guessed from their presence i really believe that had they not been so i should have rushed off incontinently and blown sphinx bronze doors and as it proved my chances of finding the time machine all together into non existence it was after that i think that we came to a little open court within the palace it was turfed and had three fruit trees so we rested and refreshed ourselves towards sunset i began to consider our position night was creeping upon us and my inaccessible hiding place had still to be found but that troubled me very little now i had in my possession a thing that was perhaps the best of all defences against the morlocks i had matches i had the camphor in my pocket too if a blaze were needed it seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open protected by a fire in the morning there was the getting of the time machine towards that as yet i had only my iron mace but now with my growing knowledge i felt very differently towards those bronze doors up to this i had refrained from forcing them largely because of the mystery on the other side they had never impressed me as being very strong and i hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the work xii in the darkness we emerged from the palace while the sun was still in part above the horizon i was determined to reach the white sphinx early the next morning and ere the dusk i purposed pushing through the woods that had stopped me on the previous journey my plan was to go as far as possible that night and then building a fire to sleep in the protection of its glare accordingly as we went along i gathered any sticks or dried grass i saw and presently had my arms full of such litter thus loaded our progress was slower than i had anticipated and besides weena was tired and i also began to suffer from sleepiness too so that it was full night before we reached the wood upon the shrubby hill of its edge weena would have stopped fearing the darkness before us but a singular sense of impending calamity that should indeed have served me as a warning drove me onward i had been without sleep for a night and two days and i was feverish and irritable i felt sleep coming upon me and the morlocks with it while we hesitated among the black bushes behind us and dim against their blackness i saw three crouching figures there was scrub and long grass all about us and i did not feel safe from their insidious approach the forest i calculated was rather less than a mile across if we could get through it to the bare hillside there as it seemed to me was an altogether safer resting place i thought that with my matches and my camphor i could contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods yet it was evident that if i was to flourish matches with my hands i should have to abandon my firewood so rather reluctantly i put it down and then it came into my head that i would amaze our friends behind by lighting it i was to discover the atrocious folly of this proceeding but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering our retreat i don t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be in the absence of man and in a temperate climate the sun s heat is rarely strong enough to burn even when it is focused by dewdrops as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts lightning may blast and blacken but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation but this rarely results in flame in this decadence too the art of fire making had been forgotten on the earth the red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to weena she wanted to run to it and play with it i believe she would have cast herself into it had i not restrained her but i caught her up and in spite of her struggles plunged boldly before me into the wood for a little way the glare of my fire lit the path looking back presently i could see through the crowded stems that from my heap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent and a curved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill i laughed at that and turned again to the dark trees before me it was very black and weena clung to me convulsively but there was still as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness sufficient light for me to avoid the stems overhead it was simply black except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there i lit none of my matches because i had no hand free upon my left arm i carried my little one in my right hand i had my iron bar for some way i heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet the faint rustle of the breeze above and my own breathing and the throb of the blood vessels in my ears then i seemed to know of a pattering behind me i pushed on grimly the pattering grew more distinct and then i caught the same queer sound and voices i had heard in the underworld there were evidently several of the morlocks and they were closing in upon me indeed in another minute i felt a tug at my coat then something at my arm and weena shivered violently and became quite still it was time for a match but to get one i must put her down i did so and as i fumbled with my pocket a struggle began in the darkness about my knees perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar cooing sounds from the morlocks soft little hands too were creeping over my coat and back touching even my neck then the match scratched and fizzed i held it flaring and saw the white backs of the morlocks in flight amid the trees i hastily took a lump of camphor from my pocket and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane then i looked at weena she was lying clutching my feet and quite motionless with her face to the ground with a sudden fright i stooped to her she seemed scarcely to breathe i lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground and as it split and flared up and drove back the morlocks and the shadows i knelt down and lifted her the wood behind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great company she seemed to have fainted i put her carefully upon my shoulder and rose to push on and then there came a horrible realisation in man uvring with my matches and weena i had turned myself about several times and now i had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my path for all i knew i might be facing back towards the palace of green porcelain i found myself in a cold sweat i had to think rapidly what to do i determined to build a fire and encamp where we were i put weena still motionless down upon a turfy bole and very hastily as my first lump of camphor waned i began collecting sticks and leaves here and there out of the darkness round me the morlocks eyes shone like carbuncles the camphor flickered and went out i lit a match and as i did so two white forms that had been approaching weena dashed hastily away one was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me and i felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist he gave a whoop of dismay staggered a little way and fell down i lit another piece of camphor and went on gathering my bonfire presently i noticed how dry was some of the foliage above me for since my arrival on the time machine a matter of a week no rain had fallen so instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs i began leaping up and dragging down branches very soon i had a choking smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks and could economise my camphor then i turned to where weena lay beside my iron mace i tried what i could to revive her but she lay like one dead i could not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed now the smoke of the fire beat over towards me and it must have made me heavy of a sudden moreover the vapour of camphor was in the air my fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so i felt very weary after my exertion and sat down the wood too was full of a slumbrous murmur that i did not understand i seemed just to nod and open my eyes but all was dark and the morlocks had their hands upon me flinging off their clinging fingers i hastily felt in my pocket for the match box and it had gone then they gripped and closed with me again in a moment i knew what had happened i had slept and my fire had gone out and the bitterness of death came over my soul the forest seemed full of the smell of burning wood i was caught by the neck by the hair by the arms and pulled down it was indescribably horrible in the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me i felt as if i was in a monstrous spider s web i was overpowered and went down i felt little teeth nipping at my neck i rolled over and as i did so my hand came against my iron lever it gave me strength i struggled up shaking the human rats from me and holding the bar short i thrust where i judged their faces might be i could feel the succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows and for a moment i was free the strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting came upon me i knew that both i and weena were lost but i determined to make the morlocks pay for their meat i stood with my back to a tree swinging the iron bar before me the whole wood was full of the stir and cries of them a minute passed their voices seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement and their movements grew faster yet none came within reach i stood glaring at the blackness then suddenly came hope what if the morlocks were afraid and close on the heels of that came a strange thing the darkness seemed to grow luminous very dimly i began to see the morlocks about me three battered at my feet and then i recognised with incredulous surprise that the others were running in an incessant stream as it seemed from behind me and away through the wood in front and their backs seemed no longer white but reddish as i stood agape i saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight between the branches and vanish and at that i understood the smell of burning wood the slumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar the red glow and the morlocks flight stepping out from behind my tree and looking back i saw through the black pillars of the nearer trees the flames of the burning forest it was my first fire coming after me with that i looked for weena but she was gone the hissing and crackling behind me the explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame left little time for reflection my iron bar still gripped i followed in the morlocks path it was a close race once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as i ran that i was outflanked and had to strike off to the left but at last i emerged upon a small open space and as i did so a morlock came blundering towards me and past me and went on straight into the fire and now i was to see the most weird and horrible thing i think of all that i beheld in that future age this whole space was as bright as day with the reflection of the fire in the centre was a hillock or tumulus surmounted by a scorched hawthorn beyond this was another arm of the burning forest with yellow tongues already writhing from it completely encircling the space with a fence of fire upon the hillside were some thirty or forty morlocks dazzled by the light and heat and blundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment at first i did not realise their blindness and struck furiously at them with my bar in a frenzy of fear as they approached me killing one and crippling several more but when i had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky and heard their moans i was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare and i struck no more of them yet every now and then one would come straight towards me setting loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him at one time the flames died down somewhat and i feared the foul creatures would presently be able to see me i was thinking of beginning the fight by killing some of them before this should happen but the fire burst out again brightly and i stayed my hand i walked about the hill among them and avoided them looking for some trace of weena but weena was gone at last i sat down on the summit of the hillock and watched this strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro and making uncanny noises to each other as the glare of the fire beat on them the coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky and through the rare tatters of that red canopy remote as though they belonged to another universe shone the little stars two or three morlocks came blundering into me and i drove them off with blows of my fists trembling as i did so for the most part of that night i was persuaded it was a nightmare i bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake i beat the ground with my hands and got up and sat down again and wandered here and there and again sat down then i would fall to rubbing my eyes and calling upon god to let me awake thrice i saw morlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the flames but at last above the subsiding red of the fire above the streaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures came the white light of the day i searched again for traces of weena but there were none it was plain that they had left her poor little body in the forest i cannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate to which it seemed destined as i thought of that i was almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me but i contained myself the hillock as i have said was a kind of island in the forest from its summit i could now make out through a haze of smoke the palace of green porcelain and from that i could get my bearings for the white sphinx and so leaving the remnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and moaning as the day grew clearer i tied some grass about my feet and limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems that still pulsated internally with fire towards the hiding place of the time machine i walked slowly for i was almost exhausted as well as lame and i felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death of little weena it seemed an overwhelming calamity now in this old familiar room it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss but that morning it left me absolutely lonely again terribly alone i began to think of this house of mine of this fireside of some of you and with such thoughts came a longing that was pain but as i walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky i made a discovery in my trouser pocket were still some loose matches the box must have leaked before it was lost xiii the trap of the white sphinx about eight or nine in the morning i came to the same seat of yellow metal from which i had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival i thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and could not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence here was the same beautiful scene the same abundant foliage the same splendid palaces and magnificent ruins the same silver river running between its fertile banks the gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and thither among the trees some were bathing in exactly the place where i had saved weena and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain and like blots upon the landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the underworld i understood now what all the beauty of the overworld people covered very pleasant was their day as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field like the cattle they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs and their end was the same i grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had been it had committed suicide it had set itself steadfastly towards comfort and ease a balanced society with security and permanency as its watchword it had attained its hopes to come to this at last once life and property must have reached almost absolute safety the rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort the toiler assured of his life and work no doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem no social question left unsolved and a great quiet had followed it is a law of nature we overlook that intellectual versatility is the compensation for change danger and trouble an animal perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless there is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change only those animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety of needs and dangers so as i see it the upperworld man had drifted towards his feeble prettiness and the underworld to mere mechanical industry but that perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical perfection absolute permanency apparently as time went on the feeding of an underworld however it was effected had become disjointed mother necessity who had been staved off for a few thousand years came back again and she began below the underworld being in contact with machinery which however perfect still needs some little thought outside habit had probably retained perforce rather more initiative if less of every other human character than the upper and when other meat failed them they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden so i say i saw it in my last view of the world of eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one it may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit could invent it is how the thing shaped itself to me and as that i give it to you after the fatigues excitements and terrors of the past days and in spite of my grief this seat and the tranquil view and the warm sunlight were very pleasant i was very tired and sleepy and soon my theorising passed into dozing catching myself at that i took my own hint and spreading myself out upon the turf i had a long and refreshing sleep i awoke a little before sunsetting i now felt safe against being caught napping by the morlocks and stretching myself i came on down the hill towards the white sphinx i had my crowbar in one hand and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket and now came a most unexpected thing as i approached the pedestal of the sphinx i found the bronze valves were open they had slid down into grooves at that i stopped short before them hesitating to enter within was a small apartment and on a raised place in the corner of this was the time machine i had the small levers in my pocket so here after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the white sphinx was a meek surrender i threw my iron bar away almost sorry not to use it a sudden thought came into my head as i stooped towards the portal for once at least i grasped the mental operations of the morlocks suppressing a strong inclination to laugh i stepped through the bronze frame and up to the time machine i was surprised to find it had been carefully oiled and cleaned i have suspected since that the morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose now as i stood and examined it finding a pleasure in the mere touch of the contrivance the thing i had expected happened the bronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang i was in the dark trapped so the morlocks thought at that i chuckled gleefully i could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me very calmly i tried to strike the match i had only to fix on the levers and depart then like a ghost but i had overlooked one little thing the matches were of that abominable kind that light only on the box you may imagine how all my calm vanished the little brutes were close upon me one touched me i made a sweeping blow in the dark at them with the levers and began to scramble into the saddle of the machine then came one hand upon me and then another then i had simply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers and at the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted one indeed they almost got away from me as it slipped from my hand i had to butt in the dark with my head i could hear the morlock s skull ring to recover it it was a nearer thing than the fight in the forest i think this last scramble but at last the lever was fixed and pulled over the clinging hands slipped from me the darkness presently fell from my eyes i found myself in the same grey light and tumult i have already described xiv the further vision i have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with time travelling and this time i was not seated properly in the saddle but sideways and in an unstable fashion for an indefinite time i clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated quite unheeding how i went and when i brought myself to look at the dials again i was amazed to find where i had arrived one dial records days and another thousands of days another millions of days and another thousands of millions now instead of reversing the levers i had pulled them over so as to go forward with them and when i came to look at these indicators i found that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch into futurity as i drove on a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things the palpitating greyness grew darker then though i was still travelling with prodigious velocity the blinking succession of day and night which was usually indicative of a slower pace returned and grew more and more marked this puzzled me very much at first the alternations of night and day grew slower and slower and so did the passage of the sun across the sky until they seemed to stretch through centuries at last a steady twilight brooded over the earth a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky the band of light that had indicated the sun had long since disappeared for the sun had ceased to set it simply rose and fell in the west and grew ever broader and more red all trace of the moon had vanished the circling of the stars growing slower and slower had given place to creeping points of light at last some time before i stopped the sun red and very large halted motionless upon the horizon a vast dome glowing with a dull heat and now and then suffering a momentary extinction at one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat i perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal drag was done the earth had come to rest with one face to the sun even as in our own time the moon faces the earth very cautiously for i remembered my former headlong fall i began to reverse my motion slower and slower went the circling hands until the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a mere mist upon its scale still slower until the dim outlines of a desolate beach grew visible i stopped very gently and sat upon the time machine looking round the sky was no longer blue north eastward it was inky black and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars overhead it was a deep indian red and starless and south eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where cut by the horizon lay the huge hull of the sun red and motionless the rocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour and all the trace of life that i could see at first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting point on their south eastern face it was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves plants which like these grow in a perpetual twilight the machine was standing on a sloping beach the sea stretched away to the south west to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky there were no breakers and no waves for not a breath of wind was stirring only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living and along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of salt pink under the lurid sky there was a sense of oppression in my head and i noticed that i was breathing very fast the sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering and from that i judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now far away up the desolate slope i heard a harsh scream and saw a thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and circling disappear over some low hillocks beyond the sound of its voice was so dismal that i shivered and seated myself more firmly upon the machine looking round me again i saw that quite near what i had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me then i saw the thing was really a monstrous crab like creature can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly its big claws swaying its long antenn like carters whips waving and feeling and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic front its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there i could see the many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it moved as i stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me i felt a tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there i tried to brush it away with my hand but in a moment it returned and almost immediately came another by my ear i struck at this and caught something threadlike it was drawn swiftly out of my hand with a frightful qualm i turned and i saw that i had grasped the antenna of another monster crab that stood just behind me its evil eyes were wriggling on their stalks its mouth was all alive with appetite and its vast ungainly claws smeared with an algal slime were descending upon me in a moment my hand was on the lever and i had placed a month between myself and these monsters but i was still on the same beach and i saw them distinctly now as soon as i stopped dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there in the sombre light among the foliated sheets of intense green i cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the world the red eastern sky the northward blackness the salt dead sea the stony beach crawling with these foul slow stirring monsters the uniform poisonous looking green of the lichenous plants the thin air that hurts one s lungs all contributed to an appalling effect i moved on a hundred years and there was the same red sun a little larger a little duller the same dying sea the same chill air and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and the red rocks and in the westward sky i saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon so i travelled stopping ever and again in great strides of a thousand years or more drawn on by the mystery of the earth s fate watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in the westward sky and the life of the old earth ebb away at last more than thirty million years hence the huge red hot dome of the sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens then i stopped once more for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared and the red beach save for its livid green liverworts and lichens seemed lifeless and now it was flecked with white a bitter cold assailed me rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down to the north eastward the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable sky and i could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white there were fringes of ice along the sea margin with drifting masses farther out but the main expanse of that salt ocean all bloody under the eternal sunset was still unfrozen i looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained a certain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the machine but i saw nothing moving in earth or sky or sea the green slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct a shallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the beach i fancied i saw some black object flopping about upon this bank but it became motionless as i looked at it and i judged that my eye had been deceived and that the black object was merely a rock the stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very little suddenly i noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had changed that a concavity a bay had appeared in the curve i saw this grow larger for a minute perhaps i stared aghast at this blackness that was creeping over the day and then i realised that an eclipse was beginning either the moon or the planet mercury was passing across the sun s disk naturally at first i took it to be the moon but there is much to incline me to believe that what i really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to the earth the darkness grew apace a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from the east and the showering white flakes in the air increased in number from the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent silent it would be hard to convey the stillness of it all the sounds of man the bleating of sheep the cries of birds the hum of insects the stir that makes the background of our lives all that was over as the darkness thickened the eddying flakes grew more abundant dancing before my eyes and the cold of the air more intense at last one by one swiftly one after the other the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into blackness the breeze rose to a moaning wind i saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me in another moment the pale stars alone were visible all else was rayless obscurity the sky was absolutely black a horror of this great darkness came on me the cold that smote to my marrow and the pain i felt in breathing overcame me i shivered and a deadly nausea seized me then like a red hot bow in the sky appeared the edge of the sun i got off the machine to recover myself i felt giddy and incapable of facing the return journey as i stood sick and confused i saw again the moving thing upon the shoal there was no mistake now that it was a moving thing against the red water of the sea it was a round thing the size of a football perhaps or it may be bigger and tentacles trailed down from it it seemed black against the weltering blood red water and it was hopping fitfully about then i felt i was fainting but a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote and awful twilight sustained me while i clambered upon the saddle xv the time traveller s return so i came back for a long time i must have been insensible upon the machine the blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed the sun got golden again the sky blue i breathed with greater freedom the fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed the hands spun backward upon the dials at last i saw again the dim shadows of houses the evidences of decadent humanity these too changed and passed and others came presently when the million dial was at zero i slackened speed i began to recognise our own pretty and familiar architecture the thousands hand ran back to the starting point the night and day flapped slower and slower then the old walls of the laboratory came round me very gently now i slowed the mechanism down i saw one little thing that seemed odd to me i think i have told you that when i set out before my velocity became very high mrs watchett had walked across the room travelling as it seemed to me like a rocket as i returned i passed again across that minute when she traversed the laboratory but now her every motion appeared to be the exact inversion of her previous ones the door at the lower end opened and she glided quietly up the laboratory back foremost and disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered just before that i seemed to see hillyer for a moment but he passed like a flash then i stopped the machine and saw about me again the old familiar laboratory my tools my appliances just as i had left them i got off the thing very shakily and sat down upon my bench for several minutes i trembled violently then i became calmer around me was my old workshop again exactly as it had been i might have slept there and the whole thing have been a dream and yet not exactly the thing had started from the south east corner of the laboratory it had come to rest again in the north west against the wall where you saw it that gives you the exact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the white sphinx into which the morlocks had carried my machine for a time my brain went stagnant presently i got up and came through the passage here limping because my heel was still painful and feeling sorely begrimed i saw the pall mall gazette on the table by the door i found the date was indeed today and looking at the timepiece saw the hour was almost eight o clock i heard your voices and the clatter of plates i hesitated i felt so sick and weak then i sniffed good wholesome meat and opened the door on you you know the rest i washed and dined and now i am telling you the story xvi after the story i know he said after a pause that all this will be absolutely incredible to you but to me the one incredible thing is that i am here tonight in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces and telling you these strange adventures he looked at the medical man no i cannot expect you to believe it take it as a lie or a prophecy say i dreamed it in the workshop consider i have been speculating upon the destinies of our race until i have hatched this fiction treat my assertion of its truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest and taking it as a story what do you think of it he took up his pipe and began in his old accustomed manner to tap with it nervously upon the bars of the grate there was a momentary stillness then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the carpet i took my eyes off the time traveller s face and looked round at his audience they were in the dark and little spots of colour swam before them the medical man seemed absorbed in the contemplation of our host the editor was looking hard at the end of his cigar the sixth the journalist fumbled for his watch the others as far as i remember were motionless the editor stood up with a sigh what a pity it is you re not a writer of stories he said putting his hand on the time traveller s shoulder you don t believe it well i thought not the time traveller turned to us where are the matches he said he lit one and spoke over his pipe puffing to tell you the truth i hardly believe it myself and yet his eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon the little table then he turned over the hand holding his pipe and i saw he was looking at some half healed scars on his knuckles the medical man rose came to the lamp and examined the flowers the gyn ceum s odd he said the psychologist leant forward to see holding out his hand for a specimen i m hanged if it isn t a quarter to one said the journalist how shall we get home plenty of cabs at the station said the psychologist it s a curious thing said the medical man but i certainly don t know the natural order of these flowers may i have them the time traveller hesitated then suddenly certainly not where did you really get them said the medical man the time traveller put his hand to his head he spoke like one who was trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him they were put into my pocket by weena when i travelled into time he stared round the room i m damned if it isn t all going this room and you and the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory did i ever make a time machine or a model of a time machine or is it all only a dream they say life is a dream a precious poor dream at times but i can t stand another that won t fit it s madness and where did the dream come from i must look at that machine if there is one he caught up the lamp swiftly and carried it flaring red through the door into the corridor we followed him there in the flickering light of the lamp was the machine sure enough squat ugly and askew a thing of brass ebony ivory and translucent glimmering quartz solid to the touch for i put out my hand and felt the rail of it and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory and bits of grass and moss upon the lower parts and one rail bent awry the time traveller put the lamp down on the bench and ran his hand along the damaged rail it s all right now he said the story i told you was true i m sorry to have brought you out here in the cold he took up the lamp and in an absolute silence we returned to the smoking room he came into the hall with us and helped the editor on with his coat the medical man looked into his face and with a certain hesitation told him he was suffering from overwork at which he laughed hugely i remember him standing in the open doorway bawling good night i shared a cab with the editor he thought the tale a gaudy lie for my own part i was unable to come to a conclusion the story was so fantastic and incredible the telling so credible and sober i lay awake most of the night thinking about it i determined to go next day and see the time traveller again i was told he was in the laboratory and being on easy terms in the house i went up to him the laboratory however was empty i stared for a minute at the time machine and put out my hand and touched the lever at that the squat substantial looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind its instability startled me extremely and i had a queer reminiscence of the childish days when i used to be forbidden to meddle i came back through the corridor the time traveller met me in the smoking room he was coming from the house he had a small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other he laughed when he saw me and gave me an elbow to shake i m frightfully busy said he with that thing in there but is it not some hoax i said do you really travel through time really and truly i do and he looked frankly into my eyes he hesitated his eye wandered about the room i only want half an hour he said i know why you came and it s awfully good of you there s some magazines here if you ll stop to lunch i ll prove you this time travelling up to the hilt specimens and all if you ll forgive my leaving you now i consented hardly comprehending then the full import of his words and he nodded and went on down the corridor i heard the door of the laboratory slam seated myself in a chair and took up a daily paper what was he going to do before lunch time then suddenly i was reminded by an advertisement that i had promised to meet richardson the publisher at two i looked at my watch and saw that i could barely save that engagement i got up and went down the passage to tell the time traveller as i took hold of the handle of the door i heard an exclamation oddly truncated at the end and a click and a thud a gust of air whirled round me as i opened the door and from within came the sound of broken glass falling on the floor the time traveller was not there i seemed to see a ghostly indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black and brass for a moment a figure so transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct but this phantasm vanished as i rubbed my eyes the time machine had gone save for a subsiding stir of dust the further end of the laboratory was empty a pane of the skylight had apparently just been blown in i felt an unreasonable amazement i knew that something strange had happened and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing might be as i stood staring the door into the garden opened and the man servant appeared we looked at each other then ideas began to come has mr gone out that way said i no sir no one has come out this way i was expecting to find him here at that i understood at the risk of disappointing richardson i stayed on waiting for the time traveller waiting for the second perhaps still stranger story and the specimens and photographs he would bring with him but i am beginning now to fear that i must wait a lifetime the time traveller vanished three years ago and as everybody knows now he has never returned epilogue one cannot choose but wonder will he ever return it may be that he swept back into the past and fell among the blood drinking hairy savages of the age of unpolished stone into the abysses of the cretaceous sea or among the grotesque saurians the huge reptilian brutes of the jurassic times he may even now if i may use the phrase be wandering on some plesiosaurus haunted oolitic coral reef or beside the lonely saline seas of the triassic age or did he go forward into one of the nearer ages in which men are still men but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome problems solved into the manhood of the race for i for my own part cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment fragmentary theory and mutual discord are indeed man s culminating time i say for my own part he i know for the question had been discussed among us long before the time machine was made thought but cheerlessly of the advancement of mankind and saw in the growing pile of civilisation only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end if that is so it remains for us to live as though it were not so but to me the future is still black and blank is a vast ignorance lit at a few casual places by the memory of his story and i have by me for my comfort two strange white flowers shrivelled now and brown and flat and brittle to witness that even when mind and strength had gone gratitude and a mutual tenderness

            "the time machine by h g wells i the time traveller for so it will be convenient to speak of him was expounding a recondite matter to us his grey eyes shone and twinkled and his usually pale face was flushed and animated the fire burned brightly and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses our chairs being his patents embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon and there was that luxurious after dinner atmosphere when thought roams gracefully free of the trammels of precision and he put it to us in this way marking the points with a lean forefinger as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox as we thought it and his fecundity you must follow me carefully i shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted the geometry for instance they taught you at school is founded on a misconception is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon said filby an argumentative person with red hair i do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it you will soon admit as much as i need from you you know of course that a mathematical line a line of thickness nil has no real existence they taught you that neither has a mathematical plane these things are mere abstractions that is all right said the psychologist nor having only length breadth and thickness can a cube have a real existence there i object said filby of course a solid body may exist all real things so most people think but wait a moment can an instantaneous cube exist don t follow you said filby can a cube that does not last for any time at all have a real existence filby became pensive clearly the time traveller proceeded any real body must have extension in four directions it must have length breadth thickness and duration but through a natural infirmity of the flesh which i will explain to you in a moment we incline to overlook this fact there are really four dimensions three which we call the three planes of space and a fourth time there is however a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives that said a very young man making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar over the lamp that very clear indeed now it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked continued the time traveller with a slight accession of cheerfulness really this is what is meant by the fourth dimension though some people who talk about the fourth dimension do not know they mean it it is only another way of looking at time there is no difference between time and any of the three dimensions of space except that our consciousness moves along it but some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea you have all heard what they have to say about this fourth dimension i have not said the provincial mayor it is simply this that space as our mathematicians have it is spoken of as having three dimensions which one may call length breadth and thickness and is always definable by reference to three planes each at right angles to the others but some philosophical people have been asking why three dimensions particularly why not another direction at right angles to the other three and have even tried to construct a four dimension geometry professor simon newcomb was expounding this to the new york mathematical society only a month or so ago you know how on a flat surface which has only two dimensions we can represent a figure of a three dimensional solid and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could represent one of four if they could master the perspective of the thing see i think so murmured the provincial mayor and knitting his brows he lapsed into an introspective state his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words yes i think i see it now he said after some time brightening in a quite transitory manner well i do not mind telling you i have been at work upon this geometry of four dimensions for some time some of my results are curious for instance here is a portrait of a man at eight years old another at fifteen another at seventeen another at twenty three and so on all these are evidently sections as it were three dimensional representations of his four dimensioned being which is a fixed and unalterable thing scientific people proceeded the time traveller after the pause required for the proper assimilation of this know very well that time is only a kind of space here is a popular scientific diagram a weather record this line i trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer yesterday it was so high yesterday night it fell then this morning it rose again and so gently upward to here surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of space generally recognized but certainly it traced such a line and that line therefore we must conclude was along the time dimension but said the medical man staring hard at a coal in the fire if time is really only a fourth dimension of space why is it and why has it always been regarded as something different and why cannot we move in time as we move about in the other dimensions of space the time traveller smiled are you sure we can move freely in space right and left we can go backward and forward freely enough and men always have done so i admit we move freely in two dimensions but how about up and down gravitation limits us there not exactly said the medical man there are balloons but before the balloons save for spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of the surface man had no freedom of vertical movement still they could move a little up and down said the medical man easier far easier down than up and you cannot move at all in time you cannot get away from the present moment my dear sir that is just where you are wrong that is just where the whole world has gone wrong we are always getting away from the present moment our mental existences which are immaterial and have no dimensions are passing along the time dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave just as we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth s surface but the great difficulty is this interrupted the psychologist you can move about in all directions of space but you cannot move about in time that is the germ of my great discovery but you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in time for instance if i am recalling an incident very vividly i go back to the instant of its occurrence i become absent minded as you say i jump back for a moment of course we have no means of staying back for any length of time any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground but a civilized man is better off than the savage in this respect he can go up against gravitation in a balloon and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the time dimension or even turn about and travel the other way oh this began filby is all why not said the time traveller it s against reason said filby what reason said the time traveller you can show black is white by argument said filby but you will never convince me possibly not said the time traveller but now you begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of four dimensions long ago i had a vague inkling of a machine to travel through time exclaimed the very young man that shall travel indifferently in any direction of space and time as the driver determines filby contented himself with laughter but i have experimental verification said the time traveller it would be remarkably convenient for the historian the psychologist suggested one might travel back and verify the accepted account of the battle of hastings for instance don t you think you would attract attention said the medical man our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms one might get one s greek from the very lips of homer and plato the very young man thought in which case they would certainly plough you for the little go the german scholars have improved greek so much then there is the future said the very young man just think one might invest all one s money leave it to accumulate at interest and hurry on ahead to discover a society said i erected on a strictly communistic basis of all the wild extravagant theories began the psychologist yes so it seemed to me and so i never talked of it until experimental verification cried i you are going to verify that the experiment cried filby who was getting brain weary let s see your experiment anyhow said the psychologist though it s all humbug you know the time traveller smiled round at us then still smiling faintly and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets he walked slowly out of the room and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory the psychologist looked at us i wonder what he s got some sleight of hand trick or other said the medical man and filby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at burslem but before he had finished his preface the time traveller came back and filby s anecdote collapsed the thing the time traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework scarcely larger than a small clock and very delicately made there was ivory in it and some transparent crystalline substance and now i must be explicit for this that follows unless his explanation is to be accepted is an absolutely unaccountable thing he took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room and set it in front of the fire with two legs on the hearthrug on this table he placed the mechanism then he drew up a chair and sat down the only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp the bright light of which fell upon the model there were also perhaps a dozen candles about two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces so that the room was brilliantly illuminated i sat in a low arm chair nearest the fire and i drew this forward so as to be almost between the time traveller and the fireplace filby sat behind him looking over his shoulder the medical man and the provincial mayor watched him in profile from the right the psychologist from the left the very young man stood behind the psychologist we were all on the alert it appears incredible to me that any kind of trick however subtly conceived and however adroitly done could have been played upon us under these conditions the time traveller looked at us and then at the mechanism well said the psychologist this little affair said the time traveller resting his elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus is only a model it is my plan for a machine to travel through time you will notice that it looks singularly askew and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar as though it was in some way unreal he pointed to the part with his finger also here is one little white lever and here is another the medical man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing it s beautifully made he said it took two years to make retorted the time traveller then when we had all imitated the action of the medical man he said now i want you clearly to understand that this lever being pressed over sends the machine gliding into the future and this other reverses the motion this saddle represents the seat of a time traveller presently i am going to press the lever and off the machine will go it will vanish pass into future time and disappear have a good look at the thing look at the table too and satisfy yourselves there is no trickery i don t want to waste this model and then be told i m a quack there was a minute s pause perhaps the psychologist seemed about to speak to me but changed his mind then the time traveller put forth his finger towards the lever no he said suddenly lend me your hand and turning to the psychologist he took that individual s hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger so that it was the psychologist himself who sent forth the model time machine on its interminable voyage we all saw the lever turn i am absolutely certain there was no trickery there was a breath of wind and the lamp flame jumped one of the candles on the mantel was blown out and the little machine suddenly swung round became indistinct was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory and it was gone vanished save for the lamp the table was bare everyone was silent for a minute then filby said he was damned the psychologist recovered from his stupor and suddenly looked under the table at that the time traveller laughed cheerfully well he said with a reminiscence of the psychologist then getting up he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel and with his back to us began to fill his pipe we stared at each other look here said the medical man are you in earnest about this do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time certainly said the time traveller stooping to light a spill at the fire then he turned lighting his pipe to look at the psychologist s face the psychologist to show that he was not unhinged helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut what is more i have a big machine nearly finished in there he indicated the laboratory and when that is put together i mean to have a journey on my own account you mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future said filby into the future or the past i don t for certain know which after an interval the psychologist had an inspiration it must have gone into the past if it has gone anywhere he said why said the time traveller because i presume that it has not moved in space and if it travelled into the future it would still be here all this time since it must have travelled through this time but i said if it travelled into the past it would have been visible when we came first into this room and last thursday when we were here and the thursday before that and so forth serious objections remarked the provincial mayor with an air of impartiality turning towards the time traveller not a bit said the time traveller and to the psychologist you think you can explain that it s presentation below the threshold you know diluted presentation of course said the psychologist and reassured us that s a simple point of psychology i should have thought of it it s plain enough and helps the paradox delightfully we cannot see it nor can we appreciate this machine any more than we can the spoke of a wheel spinning or a bullet flying through the air if it is travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are if it gets through a minute while we get through a second the impression it creates will of course be only one fiftieth or one hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in time that s plain enough he passed his hand through the space in which the machine had been you see he said laughing we sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so then the time traveller asked us what we thought of it all it sounds plausible enough to night said the medical man but wait until to morrow wait for the common sense of the morning would you like to see the time machine itself asked the time traveller and therewith taking the lamp in his hand he led the way down the long draughty corridor to his laboratory i remember vividly the flickering light his queer broad head in silhouette the dance of the shadows how we all followed him puzzled but incredulous and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes parts were of nickel parts of ivory parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of rock crystal the thing was generally complete but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of drawings and i took one up for a better look at it quartz it seemed to be look here said the medical man are you perfectly serious or is this a trick like that ghost you showed us last christmas upon that machine said the time traveller holding the lamp aloft i intend to explore time is that plain i was never more serious in my life none of us quite knew how to take it i caught filby s eye over the shoulder of the medical man and he winked at me solemnly ii i think that at that time none of us quite believed in the time machine the fact is the time traveller was one of those men who are too clever to be believed you never felt that you saw all round him you always suspected some subtle reserve some ingenuity in ambush behind his lucid frankness had filby shown the model and explained the matter in the time traveller s words we should have shown him far less scepticism for we should have perceived his motives a pork butcher could understand filby but the time traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements and we distrusted him things that would have made the frame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands it is a mistake to do things too easily the serious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment they were somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with egg shell china so i don t think any of us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that thursday and the next though its odd potentialities ran no doubt in most of our minds its plausibility that is its practical incredibleness the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested for my own part i was particularly preoccupied with the trick of the model that i remember discussing with the medical man whom i met on friday at the linnaean he said he had seen a similar thing at tubingen and laid considerable stress on the blowing out of the candle but how the trick was done he could not explain the next thursday i went again to richmond i suppose i was one of the time traveller s most constant guests and arriving late found four or five men already assembled in his drawing room the medical man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his watch in the other i looked round for the time traveller and it s half past seven now said the medical man i suppose we d better have dinner where s said i naming our host you ve just come it s rather odd he s unavoidably detained he asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he s not back says he ll explain when he comes it seems a pity to let the dinner spoil said the editor of a well known daily paper and thereupon the doctor rang the bell the psychologist was the only person besides the doctor and myself who had attended the previous dinner the other men were blank the editor aforementioned a certain journalist and another a quiet shy man with a beard whom i didn t know and who as far as my observation went never opened his mouth all the evening there was some speculation at the dinner table about the time traveller s absence and i suggested time travelling in a half jocular spirit the editor wanted that explained to him and the psychologist volunteered a wooden account of the ingenious paradox and trick we had witnessed that day week he was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise i was facing the door and saw it first hallo i said at last and the door opened wider and the time traveller stood before us i gave a cry of surprise good heavens man what s the matter cried the medical man who saw him next and the whole tableful turned towards the door he was in an amazing plight his coat was dusty and dirty and smeared with green down the sleeves his hair disordered and as it seemed to me greyer either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually faded his face was ghastly pale his chin had a brown cut on it a cut half healed his expression was haggard and drawn as by intense suffering for a moment he hesitated in the doorway as if he had been dazzled by the light then he came into the room he walked with just such a limp as i have seen in footsore tramps we stared at him in silence expecting him to speak he said not a word but came painfully to the table and made a motion towards the wine the editor filled a glass of champagne and pushed it towards him he drained it and it seemed to do him good for he looked round the table and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his face what on earth have you been up to man said the doctor the time traveller did not seem to hear don t let me disturb you he said with a certain faltering articulation i m all right he stopped held out his glass for more and took it off at a draught that s good he said his eyes grew brighter and a faint colour came into his cheeks his glance flickered over our faces with a certain dull approval and then went round the warm and comfortable room then he spoke again still as it were feeling his way among his words i m going to wash and dress and then i ll come down and explain things save me some of that mutton i m starving for a bit of meat he looked across at the editor who was a rare visitor and hoped he was all right the editor began a question tell you presently said the time traveller i m funny be all right in a minute he put down his glass and walked towards the staircase door again i remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall and standing up in my place i saw his feet as he went out he had nothing on them but a pair of tattered blood stained socks then the door closed upon him i had half a mind to follow till i remembered how he detested any fuss about himself for a minute perhaps my mind was wool gathering then remarkable behaviour of an eminent scientist i heard the editor say thinking after his wont in headlines and this brought my attention back to the bright dinner table what s the game said the journalist has he been doing the amateur cadger i don t follow i met the eye of the psychologist and read my own interpretation in his face i thought of the time traveller limping painfully upstairs i don t think any one else had noticed his lameness the first to recover completely from this surprise was the medical man who rang the bell the time traveller hated to have servants waiting at dinner for a hot plate at that the editor turned to his knife and fork with a grunt and the silent man followed suit the dinner was resumed conversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of wonderment and then the editor got fervent in his curiosity does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing or has he his nebuchadnezzar phases he inquired i feel assured it s this business of the time machine i said and took up the psychologist s account of our previous meeting the new guests were frankly incredulous the editor raised objections what was this time travelling a man couldn t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox could he and then as the idea came home to him he resorted to caricature hadn t they any clothes brushes in the future the journalist too would not believe at any price and joined the editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole thing they were both the new kind of journalist very joyous irreverent young men our special correspondent in the day after to morrow reports the journalist was saying or rather shouting when the time traveller came back he was dressed in ordinary evening clothes and nothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had startled me i say said the editor hilariously these chaps here say you have been travelling into the middle of next week tell us all about little rosebery will you what will you take for the lot the time traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word he smiled quietly in his old way where s my mutton he said what a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again story cried the editor story be damned said the time traveller i want something to eat i won t say a word until i get some peptone into my arteries thanks and the salt one word said i have you been time travelling yes said the time traveller with his mouth full nodding his head i d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note said the editor the time traveller pushed his glass towards the silent man and rang it with his fingernail at which the silent man who had been staring at his face started convulsively and poured him wine the rest of the dinner was uncomfortable for my own part sudden questions kept on rising to my lips and i dare say it was the same with the others the journalist tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of hettie potter the time traveller devoted his attention to his dinner and displayed the appetite of a tramp the medical man smoked a cigarette and watched the time traveller through his eyelashes the silent man seemed even more clumsy than usual and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of sheer nervousness at last the time traveller pushed his plate away and looked round us i suppose i must apologize he said i was simply starving i ve had a most amazing time he reached out his hand for a cigar and cut the end but come into the smoking room it s too long a story to tell over greasy plates and ringing the bell in passing he led the way into the adjoining room you have told blank and dash and chose about the machine he said to me leaning back in his easy chair and naming the three new guests but the thing s a mere paradox said the editor i can t argue to night i don t mind telling you the story but i can t argue i will he went on tell you the story of what has happened to me if you like but you must refrain from interruptions i want to tell it badly most of it will sound like lying so be it it s true every word of it all the same i was in my laboratory at four o clock and since then i ve lived eight days such days as no human being ever lived before i m nearly worn out but i shan t sleep till i ve told this thing over to you then i shall go to bed but no interruptions is it agreed agreed said the editor and the rest of us echoed agreed and with that the time traveller began his story as i have set it forth he sat back in his chair at first and spoke like a weary man afterwards he got more animated in writing it down i feel with only too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink and above all my own inadequacy to express its quality you read i will suppose attentively enough but you cannot see the speaker s white sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp nor hear the intonation of his voice you cannot know how his expression followed the turns of his story most of us hearers were in shadow for the candles in the smoking room had not been lighted and only the face of the journalist and the legs of the silent man from the knees downward were illuminated at first we glanced now and again at each other after a time we ceased to do that and looked only at the time traveller s face iii i told some of you last thursday of the principles of the time machine and showed you the actual thing itself incomplete in the workshop there it is now a little travel worn truly and one of the ivory bars is cracked and a brass rail bent but the rest of it s sound enough i expected to finish it on friday but on friday when the putting together was nearly done i found that one of the nickel bars was exactly one inch too short and this i had to get remade so that the thing was not complete until this morning it was at ten o clock to day that the first of all time machines began its career i gave it a last tap tried all the screws again put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod and sat myself in the saddle i suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as i felt then i took the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other pressed the first and almost immediately the second i seemed to reel i felt a nightmare sensation of falling and looking round i saw the laboratory exactly as before had anything happened for a moment i suspected that my intellect had tricked me then i noted the clock a moment before as it seemed it had stood at a minute or so past ten now it was nearly half past three i drew a breath set my teeth gripped the starting lever with both hands and went off with a thud the laboratory got hazy and went dark mrs watchett came in and walked apparently without seeing me towards the garden door i suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket i pressed the lever over to its extreme position the night came like the turning out of a lamp and in another moment came to morrow the laboratory grew faint and hazy then fainter and ever fainter to morrow night came black then day again night again day again faster and faster still an eddying murmur filled my ears and a strange dumb confusedness descended on my mind i am afraid i cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling they are excessively unpleasant there is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback of a helpless headlong motion i felt the same horrible anticipation too of an imminent smash as i put on pace night followed day like the flapping of a black wing the dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me and i saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky leaping it every minute and every minute marking a day i supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and i had come into the open air i had a dim impression of scaffolding but i was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things the slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me the twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye then in the intermittent darknesses i saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars presently as i went on still gaining velocity the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue a splendid luminous color like that of early twilight the jerking sun became a streak of fire a brilliant arch in space the moon a fainter fluctuating band and i could see nothing of the stars save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue the landscape was misty and vague i was still on the hill side upon which this house now stands and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim i saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour now brown now green they grew spread shivered and passed away i saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair and pass like dreams the whole surface of the earth seemed changed melting and flowing under my eyes the little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and faster presently i noted that the sun belt swayed up and down from solstice to solstice in a minute or less and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute and minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world and vanished and was followed by the bright brief green of spring the unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now they merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration i remarked indeed a clumsy swaying of the machine for which i was unable to account but my mind was too confused to attend to it so with a kind of madness growing upon me i flung myself into futurity at first i scarce thought of stopping scarce thought of anything but these new sensations but presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread until at last they took complete possession of me what strange developments of humanity what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilization i thought might not appear when i came to look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes i saw great and splendid architecture rising about me more massive than any buildings of our own time and yet as it seemed built of glimmer and mist i saw a richer green flow up the hill side and remain there without any wintry intermission even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair and so my mind came round to the business of stopping the peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in the space which i or the machine occupied so long as i travelled at a high velocity through time this scarcely mattered i was so to speak attenuated was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of intervening substances but to come to a stop involved the jamming of myself molecule by molecule into whatever lay in my way meant bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical reaction possibly a far reaching explosion would result and blow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions into the unknown this possibility had occurred to me again and again while i was making the machine but then i had cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk one of the risks a man has got to take now the risk was inevitable i no longer saw it in the same cheerful light the fact is that insensibly the absolute strangeness of everything the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine above all the feeling of prolonged falling had absolutely upset my nerve i told myself that i could never stop and with a gust of petulance i resolved to stop forthwith like an impatient fool i lugged over the lever and incontinently the thing went reeling over and i was flung headlong through the air there was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears i may have been stunned for a moment a pitiless hail was hissing round me and i was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine everything still seemed grey but presently i remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone i looked round me i was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a garden surrounded by rhododendron bushes and i noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the hail stones the rebounding dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine and drove along the ground like smoke in a moment i was wet to the skin fine hospitality said i to a man who has travelled innumerable years to see you presently i thought what a fool i was to get wet i stood up and looked round me a colossal figure carved apparently in some white stone loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy downpour but all else of the world was invisible my sensations would be hard to describe as the columns of hail grew thinner i saw the white figure more distinctly it was very large for a silver birch tree touched its shoulder it was of white marble in shape something like a winged sphinx but the wings instead of being carried vertically at the sides were spread so that it seemed to hover the pedestal it appeared to me was of bronze and was thick with verdigris it chanced that the face was towards me the sightless eyes seemed to watch me there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips it was greatly weather worn and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease i stood looking at it for a little space half a minute perhaps or half an hour it seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it denser or thinner at last i tore my eyes from it for a moment and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare and that the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun i looked up again at the crouching white shape and the full temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me what might appear when that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn what might not have happened to men what if cruelty had grown into a common passion what if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had developed into something inhuman unsympathetic and overwhelmingly powerful i might seem some old world savage animal only the more dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness a foul creature to be incontinently slain already i saw other vast shapes huge buildings with intricate parapets and tall columns with a wooded hill side dimly creeping in upon me through the lessening storm i was seized with a panic fear i turned frantically to the time machine and strove hard to readjust it as i did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm the grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a ghost above me in the intense blue of the summer sky some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness the great buildings about me stood out clear and distinct shining with the wet of the thunderstorm and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses i felt naked in a strange world i felt as perhaps a bird may feel in the clear air knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop my fear grew to frenzy i took a breathing space set my teeth and again grappled fiercely wrist and knee with the machine it gave under my desperate onset and turned over it struck my chin violently one hand on the saddle the other on the lever i stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again but with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered i looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote future in a circular opening high up in the wall of the nearer house i saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes they had seen me and their faces were directed towards me then i heard voices approaching me coming through the bushes by the white sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running one of these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which i stood with my machine he was a slight creature perhaps four feet high clad in a purple tunic girdled at the waist with a leather belt sandals or buskins i could not clearly distinguish which were on his feet his legs were bare to the knees and his head was bare noticing that i noticed for the first time how warm the air was he struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature but indescribably frail his flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much at the sight of him i suddenly regained confidence i took my hands from the machine iv in another moment we were standing face to face i and this fragile thing out of futurity he came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes the absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue there were others coming and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me one of them addressed me it came into my head oddly enough that my voice was too harsh and deep for them so i shook my head and pointing to my ears shook it again he came a step forward hesitated and then touched my hand then i felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders they wanted to make sure i was real there was nothing in this at all alarming indeed there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence a graceful gentleness a certain childlike ease and besides they looked so frail that i could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like nine pins but i made a sudden motion to warn them when i saw their little pink hands feeling at the time machine happily then when it was not too late i thought of a danger i had hitherto forgotten and reaching over the bars of the machine i unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion and put these in my pocket then i turned again to see what i could do in the way of communication and then looking more nearly into their features i saw some further peculiarities in their dresden china type of prettiness their hair which was uniformly curly came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face and their ears were singularly minute the mouths were small with bright red rather thin lips and the little chins ran to a point the eyes were large and mild and this may seem egotism on my part i fancied even that there was a certain lack of the interest i might have expected in them as they made no effort to communicate with me but simply stood round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other i began the conversation i pointed to the time machine and to myself then hesitating for a moment how to express time i pointed to the sun at once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed my gesture and then astonished me by imitating the sound of thunder for a moment i was staggered though the import of his gesture was plain enough the question had come into my mind abruptly were these creatures fools you may hardly understand how it took me you see i had always anticipated that the people of the year eight hundred and two thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge art everything then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of our five year old children asked me in fact if i had come from the sun in a thunderstorm it let loose the judgment i had suspended upon their clothes their frail light limbs and fragile features a flow of disappointment rushed across my mind for a moment i felt that i had built the time machine in vain i nodded pointed to the sun and gave them such a vivid rendering of a thunderclap as startled them they all withdrew a pace or so and bowed then came one laughing towards me carrying a chain of beautiful flowers altogether new to me and put it about my neck the idea was received with melodious applause and presently they were all running to and fro for flowers and laughingly flinging them upon me until i was almost smothered with blossom you who have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created then someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the nearest building and so i was led past the sphinx of white marble which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my astonishment towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone as i went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came with irresistible merriment to my mind the building had a huge entry and was altogether of colossal dimensions i was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of little people and with the big open portals that yawned before me shadowy and mysterious my general impression of the world i saw over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers a long neglected and yet weedless garden i saw a number of tall spikes of strange white flowers measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals they grew scattered as if wild among the variegated shrubs but as i say i did not examine them closely at this time the time machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons the arch of the doorway was richly carved but naturally i did not observe the carving very narrowly though i fancied i saw suggestions of old phoenician decorations as i passed through and it struck me that they were very badly broken and weather worn several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway and so we entered i dressed in dingy nineteenth century garments looking grotesque enough garlanded with flowers and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright soft colored robes and shining white limbs in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech the big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with brown the roof was in shadow and the windows partially glazed with coloured glass and partially unglazed admitted a tempered light the floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal not plates nor slabs blocks and it was so much worn as i judged by the going to and fro of past generations as to be deeply channelled along the more frequented ways transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone raised perhaps a foot from the floor and upon these were heaps of fruits some i recognized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange but for the most part they were strange between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions upon these my conductors seated themselves signing for me to do likewise with a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with their hands flinging peel and stalks and so forth into the round openings in the sides of the tables i was not loath to follow their example for i felt thirsty and hungry as i did so i surveyed the hall at my leisure and perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look the stained glass windows which displayed only a geometrical pattern were broken in many places and the curtains that hung across the lower end were thick with dust and it caught my eye that the corner of the marble table near me was fractured nevertheless the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque there were perhaps a couple of hundred people dining in the hall and most of them seated as near to me as they could come were watching me with interest their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating all were clad in the same soft and yet strong silky material fruit by the by was all their diet these people of the remote future were strict vegetarians and while i was with them in spite of some carnal cravings i had to be frugivorous also indeed i found afterwards that horses cattle sheep dogs had followed the ichthyosaurus into extinction but the fruits were very delightful one in particular that seemed to be in season all the time i was there a floury thing in a three sided husk was especially good and i made it my staple at first i was puzzled by all these strange fruits and by the strange flowers i saw but later i began to perceive their import however i am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future now so soon as my appetite was a little checked i determined to make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine clearly that was the next thing to do the fruits seemed a convenient thing to begin upon and holding one of these up i began a series of interrogative sounds and gestures i had some considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning at first my efforts met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter but presently a fair haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name they had to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount of amusement however i felt like a schoolmaster amidst children and persisted and presently i had a score of noun substantives at least at my command and then i got to demonstrative pronouns and even the verb to eat but it was slow work and the little people soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations so i determined rather of necessity to let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined and very little doses i found they were before long for i never met people more indolent or more easily fatigued a queer thing i soon discovered about my little hosts and that was their lack of interest they would come to me with eager cries of astonishment like children but like children they would soon stop examining me and wander away after some other toy the dinner and my conversational beginnings ended i noted for the first time that almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone it is odd too how speedily i came to disregard these little people i went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was satisfied i was continually meeting more of these men of the future who would follow me a little distance chatter and laugh about me and having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way leave me again to my own devices the calm of evening was upon the world as i emerged from the great hall and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun at first things were very confusing everything was so entirely different from the world i had known even the flowers the big building i had left was situated on the slope of a broad river valley but the thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present position i resolved to mount to the summit of a crest perhaps a mile and a half away from which i could get a wider view of this our planet in the year eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one a d for that i should explain was the date the little dials of my machine recorded as i walked i was watching for every impression that could possibly help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which i found the world for ruinous it was a little way up the hill for instance was a great heap of granite bound together by masses of aluminium a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda like plants nettles possibly but wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves and incapable of stinging it was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure to what end built i could not determine it was here that i was destined at a later date to have a very strange experience the first intimation of a still stranger discovery but of that i will speak in its proper place looking round with a sudden thought from a terrace on which i rested for a while i realized that there were no small houses to be seen apparently the single house and possibly even the household had vanished here and there among the greenery were palace like buildings but the house and the cottage which form such characteristic features of our own english landscape had disappeared communism said i to myself and on the heels of that came another thought i looked at the half dozen little figures that were following me then in a flash i perceived that all had the same form of costume the same soft hairless visage and the same girlish rotundity of limb it may seem strange perhaps that i had not noticed this before but everything was so strange now i saw the fact plainly enough in costume and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each other these people of the future were alike and the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents i judged then that the children of that time were extremely precocious physically at least and i found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion seeing the ease and security in which these people were living i felt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would expect for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman the institution of the family and the differentiation of occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical force where population is balanced and abundant much childbearing becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the state where violence comes but rarely and off spring are secure there is less necessity indeed there is no necessity for an efficient family and the specialization of the sexes with reference to their children s needs disappears we see some beginnings of this even in our own time and in this future age it was complete this i must remind you was my speculation at the time later i was to appreciate how far it fell short of the reality while i was musing upon these things my attention was attracted by a pretty little structure like a well under a cupola i thought in a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing and then resumed the thread of my speculations there were no large buildings towards the top of the hill and as my walking powers were evidently miraculous i was presently left alone for the first time with a strange sense of freedom and adventure i pushed on up to the crest there i found a seat of some yellow metal that i did not recognize corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in soft moss the arm rests cast and filed into the resemblance of griffins heads i sat down on it and i surveyed the broad view of our old world under the sunset of that long day it was as sweet and fair a view as i have ever seen the sun had already gone below the horizon and the west was flaming gold touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson below was the valley of the thames in which the river lay like a band of burnished steel i have already spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery some in ruins and some still occupied here and there rose a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth here and there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk there were no hedges no signs of proprietary rights no evidences of agriculture the whole earth had become a garden so watching i began to put my interpretation upon the things i had seen and as it shaped itself to me that evening my interpretation was something in this way afterwards i found i had got only a half truth or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth it seemed to me that i had happened upon humanity upon the wane the ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind for the first time i began to realize an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged and yet come to think it is a logical consequence enough strength is the outcome of need security sets a premium on feebleness the work of ameliorating the conditions of life the true civilizing process that makes life more and more secure had gone steadily on to a climax one triumph of a united humanity over nature had followed another things that are now mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried forward and the harvest was what i saw after all the sanitation and the agriculture of to day are still in the rudimentary stage the science of our time has attacked but a little department of the field of human disease but even so it spreads its operations very steadily and persistently our agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants leaving the greater number to fight out a balance as they can we improve our favourite plants and animals and how few they are gradually by selective breeding now a new and better peach now a seedless grape now a sweeter and larger flower now a more convenient breed of cattle we improve them gradually because our ideals are vague and tentative and our knowledge is very limited because nature too is shy and slow in our clumsy hands some day all this will be better organized and still better that is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies the whole world will be intelligent educated and co operating things will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of nature in the end wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit our human needs this adjustment i say must have been done and done well done indeed for all time in the space of time across which my machine had leaped the air was free from gnats the earth from weeds or fungi everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither the ideal of preventive medicine was attained diseases had been stamped out i saw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay and i shall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been profoundly affected by these changes social triumphs too had been effected i saw mankind housed in splendid shelters gloriously clothed and as yet i had found them engaged in no toil there were no signs of struggle neither social nor economical struggle the shop the advertisement traffic all that commerce which constitutes the body of our world was gone it was natural on that golden evening that i should jump at the idea of a social paradise the difficulty of increasing population had been met i guessed and population had ceased to increase but with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the change what unless biological science is a mass of errors is the cause of human intelligence and vigour hardship and freedom conditions under which the active strong and subtle survive and the weaker go to the wall conditions that put a premium upon the loyal alliance of capable men upon self restraint patience and decision and the institution of the family and the emotions that arise therein the fierce jealousy the tenderness for offspring parental self devotion all found their justification and support in the imminent dangers of the young now where are these imminent dangers there is a sentiment arising and it will grow against connubial jealousy against fierce maternity against passion of all sorts unnecessary things now and things that make us uncomfortable savage survivals discords in a refined and pleasant life i thought of the physical slightness of the people their lack of intelligence and those big abundant ruins and it strengthened my belief in a perfect conquest of nature for after the battle comes quiet humanity had been strong energetic and intelligent and had used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it lived and now came the reaction of the altered conditions under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security that restless energy that with us is strength would become weakness even in our own time certain tendencies and desires once necessary to survival are a constant source of failure physical courage and the love of battle for instance are no great help may even be hindrances to a civilized man and in a state of physical balance and security power intellectual as well as physical would be out of place for countless years i judged there had been no danger of war or solitary violence no danger from wild beasts no wasting disease to require strength of constitution no need of toil for such a life what we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong are indeed no longer weak better equipped indeed they are for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet no doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings i saw was the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived the flourish of that triumph which began the last great peace this has ever been the fate of energy in security it takes to art and to eroticism and then come languor and decay even this artistic impetus would at last die away had almost died in the time i saw to adorn themselves with flowers to dance to sing in the sunlight so much was left of the artistic spirit and no more even that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity we are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity and it seemed to me that here was that hateful grindstone broken at last as i stood there in the gathering dark i thought that in this simple explanation i had mastered the problem of the world mastered the whole secret of these delicious people possibly the checks they had devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well and their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary that would account for the abandoned ruins very simple was my explanation and plausible enough as most wrong theories are v as i stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man the full moon yellow and gibbous came up out of an overflow of silver light in the north east the bright little figures ceased to move about below a noiseless owl flitted by and i shivered with the chill of the night i determined to descend and find where i could sleep i looked for the building i knew then my eye travelled along to the figure of the white sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze growing distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter i could see the silver birch against it there was the tangle of rhododendron bushes black in the pale light and there was the little lawn i looked at the lawn again a queer doubt chilled my complacency no said i stoutly to myself that was not the lawn but it was the lawn for the white leprous face of the sphinx was towards it can you imagine what i felt as this conviction came home to me but you cannot the time machine was gone at once like a lash across the face came the possibility of losing my own age of being left helpless in this strange new world the bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation i could feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing in another moment i was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope once i fell headlong and cut my face i lost no time in stanching the blood but jumped up and ran on with a warm trickle down my cheek and chin all the time i ran i was saying to myself they have moved it a little pushed it under the bushes out of the way nevertheless i ran with all my might all the time with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread i knew that such assurance was folly knew instinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach my breath came with pain i suppose i covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the little lawn two miles perhaps in ten minutes and i am not a young man i cursed aloud as i ran at my confident folly in leaving the machine wasting good breath thereby i cried aloud and none answered not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit world when i reached the lawn my worst fears were realized not a trace of the thing was to be seen i felt faint and cold when i faced the empty space among the black tangle of bushes i ran round it furiously as if the thing might be hidden in a corner and then stopped abruptly with my hands clutching my hair above me towered the sphinx upon the bronze pedestal white shining leprous in the light of the rising moon it seemed to smile in mockery of my dismay i might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put the mechanism in some shelter for me had i not felt assured of their physical and intellectual inadequacy that is what dismayed me the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power through whose intervention my invention had vanished yet for one thing i felt assured unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate the machine could not have moved in time the attachment of the levers i will show you the method later prevented any one from tampering with it in that way when they were removed it had moved and was hid only in space but then where could it be i think i must have had a kind of frenzy i remember running violently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx and startling some white animal that in the dim light i took for a small deer i remember too late that night beating the bushes with my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs then sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind i went down to the great building of stone the big hall was dark silent and deserted i slipped on the uneven floor and fell over one of the malachite tables almost breaking my shin i lit a match and went on past the dusty curtains of which i have told you there i found a second great hall covered with cushions upon which perhaps a score or so of the little people were sleeping i have no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough coming suddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter and flare of a match for they had forgotten about matches where is my time machine i began bawling like an angry child laying hands upon them and shaking them up together it must have been very queer to them some laughed most of them looked sorely frightened when i saw them standing round me it came into my head that i was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the circumstances in trying to revive the sensation of fear for reasoning from their daylight behaviour i thought that fear must be forgotten abruptly i dashed down the match and knocking one of the people over in my course went blundering across the big dining hall again out under the moonlight i heard cries of terror and their little feet running and stumbling this way and that i do not remember all i did as the moon crept up the sky i suppose it was the unexpected nature of my loss that maddened me i felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind a strange animal in an unknown world i must have raved to and fro screaming and crying upon god and fate i have a memory of horrible fatigue as the long night of despair wore away of looking in this impossible place and that of groping among moon lit ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows at last of lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness i had nothing left but misery then i slept and when i woke again it was full day and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm i sat up in the freshness of the morning trying to remember how i had got there and why i had such a profound sense of desertion and despair then things came clear in my mind with the plain reasonable daylight i could look my circumstances fairly in the face i saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight and i could reason with myself suppose the worst i said suppose the machine altogether lost perhaps destroyed it behoves me to be calm and patient to learn the way of the people to get a clear idea of the method of my loss and the means of getting materials and tools so that in the end perhaps i may make another that would be my only hope perhaps but better than despair and after all it was a beautiful and curious world but probably the machine had only been taken away still i must be calm and patient find its hiding place and recover it by force or cunning and with that i scrambled to my feet and looked about me wondering where i could bathe i felt weary stiff and travel soiled the freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness i had exhausted my emotion indeed as i went about my business i found myself wondering at my intense excitement overnight i made a careful examination of the ground about the little lawn i wasted some time in futile questionings conveyed as well as i was able to such of the little people as came by they all failed to understand my gestures some were simply stolid some thought it was a jest and laughed at me i had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces it was a foolish impulse but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity the turf gave better counsel i found a groove ripped in it about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet where on arrival i had struggled with the overturned machine there were other signs of removal about with queer narrow footprints like those i could imagine made by a sloth this directed my closer attention to the pedestal it was as i think i have said of bronze it was not a mere block but highly decorated with deep framed panels on either side i went and rapped at these the pedestal was hollow examining the panels with care i found them discontinuous with the frames there were no handles or keyholes but possibly the panels if they were doors as i supposed opened from within one thing was clear enough to my mind it took no very great mental effort to infer that my time machine was inside that pedestal but how it got there was a different problem i saw the heads of two orange clad people coming through the bushes and under some blossom covered apple trees towards me i turned smiling to them and beckoned them to me they came and then pointing to the bronze pedestal i tried to intimate my wish to open it but at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly i don t know how to convey their expression to you suppose you were to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate minded woman it is how she would look they went off as if they had received the last possible insult i tried a sweet looking little chap in white next with exactly the same result somehow his manner made me feel ashamed of myself but as you know i wanted the time machine and i tried him once more as he turned off like the others my temper got the better of me in three strides i was after him had him by the loose part of his robe round the neck and began dragging him towards the sphinx then i saw the horror and repugnance of his face and all of a sudden i let him go but i was not beaten yet i banged with my fist at the bronze panels i thought i heard something stir inside to be explicit i thought i heard a sound like a chuckle but i must have been mistaken then i got a big pebble from the river and came and hammered till i had flattened a coil in the decorations and the verdigris came off in powdery flakes the delicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand but nothing came of it i saw a crowd of them upon the slopes looking furtively at me at last hot and tired i sat down to watch the place but i was too restless to watch long i am too occidental for a long vigil i could work at a problem for years but to wait inactive for twenty four hours that is another matter i got up after a time and began walking aimlessly through the bushes towards the hill again patience said i to myself if you want your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone if they mean to take your machine away it s little good your wrecking their bronze panels and if they don t you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it to sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is hopeless that way lies monomania face this world learn its ways watch it be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning in the end you will find clues to it all then suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind the thought of the years i had spent in study and toil to get into the future age and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it i had made myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a man devised although it was at my own expense i could not help myself i laughed aloud going through the big palace it seemed to me that the little people avoided me it may have been my fancy or it may have had something to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze yet i felt tolerably sure of the avoidance i was careful however to show no concern and to abstain from any pursuit of them and in the course of a day or two things got back to the old footing i made what progress i could in the language and in addition i pushed my explorations here and there either i missed some subtle point or their language was excessively simple almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs there seemed to be few if any abstract terms or little use of figurative language their sentences were usually simple and of two words and i failed to convey or understand any but the simplest propositions i determined to put the thought of my time machine and the mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural way yet a certain feeling you may understand tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival so far as i could see all the world displayed the same exuberant richness as the thames valley from every hill i climbed i saw the same abundance of splendid buildings endlessly varied in material and style the same clustering thickets of evergreens the same blossom laden trees and tree ferns here and there water shone like silver and beyond the land rose into blue undulating hills and so faded into the serenity of the sky a peculiar feature which presently attracted my attention was the presence of certain circular wells several as it seemed to me of a very great depth one lay by the path up the hill which i had followed during my first walk like the others it was rimmed with bronze curiously wrought and protected by a little cupola from the rain sitting by the side of these wells and peering down into the shafted darkness i could see no gleam of water nor could i start any reflection with a lighted match but in all of them i heard a certain sound a thud thud thud like the beating of some big engine and i discovered from the flaring of my matches that a steady current of air set down the shafts further i threw a scrap of paper into the throat of one and instead of fluttering slowly down it was at once sucked swiftly out of sight after a time too i came to connect these wells with tall towers standing here and there upon the slopes for above them there was often just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a sun scorched beach putting things together i reached a strong suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation whose true import it was difficult to imagine i was at first inclined to associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people it was an obvious conclusion but it was absolutely wrong and here i must admit that i learned very little of drains and bells and modes of conveyance and the like conveniences during my time in this real future in some of these visions of utopias and coming times which i have read there is a vast amount of detail about building and social arrangements and so forth but while such details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is contained in one s imagination they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid such realities as i found here conceive the tale of london which a negro fresh from central africa would take back to his tribe what would he know of railway companies of social movements of telephone and telegraph wires of the parcels delivery company and postal orders and the like yet we at least should be willing enough to explain these things to him and even of what he knew how much could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe then think how narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times and how wide the interval between myself and these of the golden age i was sensible of much which was unseen and which contributed to my comfort but save for a general impression of automatic organization i fear i can convey very little of the difference to your mind in the matter of sepulture for instance i could see no signs of crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs but it occurred to me that possibly there might be cemeteries or crematoria somewhere beyond the range of my explorings this again was a question i deliberately put to myself and my curiosity was at first entirely defeated upon the point the thing puzzled me and i was led to make a further remark which puzzled me still more that aged and infirm among this people there were none i must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an automatic civilization and a decadent humanity did not long endure yet i could think of no other let me put my difficulties the several big palaces i had explored were mere living places great dining halls and sleeping apartments i could find no machinery no appliances of any kind yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at times need renewal and their sandals though undecorated were fairly complex specimens of metalwork somehow such things must be made and the little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency there were no shops no workshops no sign of importations among them they spent all their time in playing gently in bathing in the river in making love in a half playful fashion in eating fruit and sleeping i could not see how things were kept going then again about the time machine something i knew not what had taken it into the hollow pedestal of the white sphinx why for the life of me i could not imagine those waterless wells too those flickering pillars i felt i lacked a clue i felt how shall i put it suppose you found an inscription with sentences here and there in excellent plain english and interpolated therewith others made up of words of letters even absolutely unknown to you well on the third day of my visit that was how the world of eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one presented itself to me that day too i made a friend of a sort it happened that as i was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow one of them was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream the main current ran rather swiftly but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer it will give you an idea therefore of the strange deficiency in these creatures when i tell you that none made the slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes when i realized this i hurriedly slipped off my clothes and wading in at a point lower down i caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land a little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round and i had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before i left her i had got to such a low estimate of her kind that i did not expect any gratitude from her in that however i was wrong this happened in the morning in the afternoon i met my little woman as i believe it was as i was returning towards my centre from an exploration and she received me with cries of delight and presented me with a big garland of flowers evidently made for me and me alone the thing took my imagination very possibly i had been feeling desolate at any rate i did my best to display my appreciation of the gift we were soon seated together in a little stone arbour engaged in conversation chiefly of smiles the creature s friendliness affected me exactly as a child s might have done we passed each other flowers and she kissed my hands i did the same to hers then i tried talk and found that her name was weena which though i don t know what it meant somehow seemed appropriate enough that was the beginning of a queer friendship which lasted a week and ended as i will tell you she was exactly like a child she wanted to be with me always she tried to follow me everywhere and on my next journey out and about it went to my heart to tire her down and leave her at last exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively but the problems of the world had to be mastered i had not i said to myself come into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation yet her distress when i left her was very great her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic and i think altogether i had as much trouble as comfort from her devotion nevertheless she was somehow a very great comfort i thought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me until it was too late i did not clearly know what i had inflicted upon her when i left her nor until it was too late did i clearly understand what she was to me for by merely seeming fond of me and showing in her weak futile way that she cared for me the little doll of a creature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the white sphinx almost the feeling of coming home and i would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold so soon as i came over the hill it was from her too that i learned that fear had not yet left the world she was fearless enough in the daylight and she had the oddest confidence in me for once in a foolish moment i made threatening grimaces at her and she simply laughed at them but she dreaded the dark dreaded shadows dreaded black things darkness to her was the one thing dreadful it was a singularly passionate emotion and it set me thinking and observing i discovered then among other things that these little people gathered into the great houses after dark and slept in droves to enter upon them without a light was to put them into a tumult of apprehension i never found one out of doors or one sleeping alone within doors after dark yet i was still such a blockhead that i missed the lesson of that fear and in spite of weena s distress i insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering multitudes it troubled her greatly but in the end her odd affection for me triumphed and for five of the nights of our acquaintance including the last night of all she slept with her head pillowed on my arm but my story slips away from me as i speak of her it must have been the night before her rescue that i was awakened about dawn i had been restless dreaming most disagreeably that i was drowned and that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps i woke with a start and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed out of the chamber i tried to get to sleep again but i felt restless and uncomfortable it was that dim grey hour when things are just creeping out of darkness when everything is colourless and clear cut and yet unreal i got up and went down into the great hall and so out upon the flagstones in front of the palace i thought i would make a virtue of necessity and see the sunrise the moon was setting and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of dawn were mingled in a ghastly half light the bushes were inky black the ground a sombre grey the sky colourless and cheerless and up the hill i thought i could see ghosts there several times as i scanned the slope i saw white figures twice i fancied i saw a solitary white ape like creature running rather quickly up the hill and once near the ruins i saw a leash of them carrying some dark body they moved hastily i did not see what became of them it seemed that they vanished among the bushes the dawn was still indistinct you must understand i was feeling that chill uncertain early morning feeling you may have known i doubted my eyes as the eastern sky grew brighter and the light of the day came on and its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more i scanned the view keenly but i saw no vestige of my white figures they were mere creatures of the half light they must have been ghosts i said i wonder whence they dated for a queer notion of grant allen s came into my head and amused me if each generation die and leave ghosts he argued the world at last will get overcrowded with them on that theory they would have grown innumerable some eight hundred thousand years hence and it was no great wonder to see four at once but the jest was unsatisfying and i was thinking of these figures all the morning until weena s rescue drove them out of my head i associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal i had startled in my first passionate search for the time machine but weena was a pleasant substitute yet all the same they were soon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind i think i have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of this golden age i cannot account for it it may be that the sun was hotter or the earth nearer the sun it is usual to assume that the sun will go on cooling steadily in the future but people unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger darwin forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body as these catastrophes occur the sun will blaze with renewed energy and it may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate whatever the reason the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know it well one very hot morning my fourth i think as i was seeking shelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where i slept and fed there happened this strange thing clambering among these heaps of masonry i found a narrow gallery whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone by contrast with the brilliancy outside it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me i entered it groping for the change from light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me suddenly i halted spellbound a pair of eyes luminous by reflection against the daylight without was watching me out of the darkness the old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me i clenched my hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs i was afraid to turn then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living came to my mind and then i remembered that strange terror of the dark overcoming my fear to some extent i advanced a step and spoke i will admit that my voice was harsh and ill controlled i put out my hand and touched something soft at once the eyes darted sideways and something white ran past me i turned with my heart in my mouth and saw a queer little ape like figure its head held down in a peculiar manner running across the sunlit space behind me it blundered against a block of granite staggered aside and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry my impression of it is of course imperfect but i know it was a dull white and had strange large greyish red eyes also that there was flaxen hair on its head and down its back but as i say it went too fast for me to see distinctly i cannot even say whether it ran on all fours or only with its forearms held very low after an instant s pause i followed it into the second heap of ruins i could not find it at first but after a time in the profound obscurity i came upon one of those round well like openings of which i have told you half closed by a fallen pillar a sudden thought came to me could this thing have vanished down the shaft i lit a match and looking down i saw a small white moving creature with large bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated it made me shudder it was so like a human spider it was clambering down the wall and now i saw for the first time a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand going out as it dropped and when i had lit another the little monster had disappeared i do not know how long i sat peering down that well it was not for some time that i could succeed in persuading myself that the thing i had seen was human but gradually the truth dawned on me that man had not remained one species but had differentiated into two distinct animals that my graceful children of the upper world were not the sole descendants of our generation but that this bleached obscene nocturnal thing which had flashed before me was also heir to all the ages i thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground ventilation i began to suspect their true import and what i wondered was this lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced organization how was it related to the indolent serenity of the beautiful upper worlders and what was hidden down there at the foot of that shaft i sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that at any rate there was nothing to fear and that there i must descend for the solution of my difficulties and withal i was absolutely afraid to go as i hesitated two of the beautiful upper world people came running in their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow the male pursued the female flinging flowers at her as he ran they seemed distressed to find me my arm against the overturned pillar peering down the well apparently it was considered bad form to remark these apertures for when i pointed to this one and tried to frame a question about it in their tongue they were still more visibly distressed and turned away but they were interested by my matches and i struck some to amuse them i tried them again about the well and again i failed so presently i left them meaning to go back to weena and see what i could get from her but my mind was already in revolution my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a new adjustment i had now a clue to the import of these wells to the ventilating towers to the mystery of the ghosts to say nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the time machine and very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me here was the new view plainly this second species of man was subterranean there were three circumstances in particular which made me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a long continued underground habit in the first place there was the bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark the white fish of the kentucky caves for instance then those large eyes with that capacity for reflecting light are common features of nocturnal things witness the owl and the cat and last of all that evident confusion in the sunshine that hasty yet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow and that peculiar carriage of the head while in the light all reinforced the theory of an extreme sensitiveness of the retina beneath my feet then the earth must be tunnelled enormously and these tunnellings were the habitat of the new race the presence of ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes everywhere in fact except along the river valley showed how universal were its ramifications what so natural then as to assume that it was in this artificial underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of the daylight race was done the notion was so plausible that i at once accepted it and went on to assume the how of this splitting of the human species i dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory though for myself i very soon felt that it fell far short of the truth at first proceeding from the problems of our own age it seemed clear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely temporary and social difference between the capitalist and the labourer was the key to the whole position no doubt it will seem grotesque enough to you and wildly incredible and yet even now there are existing circumstances to point that way there is a tendency to utilize underground space for the less ornamental purposes of civilization there is the metropolitan railway in london for instance there are new electric railways there are subways there are underground workrooms and restaurants and they increase and multiply evidently i thought this tendency had increased till industry had gradually lost its birthright in the sky i mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories spending a still increasing amount of its time therein till in the end even now does not an east end worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the earth again the exclusive tendency of richer people due no doubt to the increasing refinement of their education and the widening gulf between them and the rude violence of the poor is already leading to the closing in their interest of considerable portions of the surface of the land about london for instance perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against intrusion and this same widening gulf which is due to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the part of the rich will make that exchange between class and class that promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines of social stratification less and less frequent so in the end above ground you must have the haves pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty and below ground the have nots the workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of their labour once they were there they would no doubt have to pay rent and not a little of it for the ventilation of their caverns and if they refused they would starve or be suffocated for arrears such of them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die and in the end the balance being permanent the survivors would become as well adapted to the conditions of underground life and as happy in their way as the upper world people were to theirs as it seemed to me the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally enough the great triumph of humanity i had dreamed of took a different shape in my mind it had been no such triumph of moral education and general co operation as i had imagined instead i saw a real aristocracy armed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the industrial system of to day its triumph had not been simply a triumph over nature but a triumph over nature and the fellow man this i must warn you was my theory at the time i had no convenient cicerone in the pattern of the utopian books my explanation may be absolutely wrong i still think it is the most plausible one but even on this supposition the balanced civilization that was at last attained must have long since passed its zenith and was now far fallen into decay the too perfect security of the upper worlders had led them to a slow movement of degeneration to a general dwindling in size strength and intelligence that i could see clearly enough already what had happened to the under grounders i did not yet suspect but from what i had seen of the morlocks that by the by was the name by which these creatures were called i could imagine that the modification of the human type was even far more profound than among the eloi the beautiful race that i already knew then came troublesome doubts why had the morlocks taken my time machine for i felt sure it was they who had taken it why too if the eloi were masters could they not restore the machine to me and why were they so terribly afraid of the dark i proceeded as i have said to question weena about this under world but here again i was disappointed at first she would not understand my questions and presently she refused to answer them she shivered as though the topic was unendurable and when i pressed her perhaps a little harshly she burst into tears they were the only tears except my own i ever saw in that golden age when i saw them i ceased abruptly to trouble about the morlocks and was only concerned in banishing these signs of the human inheritance from weena s eyes and very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands while i solemnly burned a match vi it may seem odd to you but it was two days before i could follow up the new found clue in what was manifestly the proper way i felt a peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies they were just the half bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in spirit in a zoological museum and they were filthily cold to the touch probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the eloi whose disgust of the morlocks i now began to appreciate the next night i did not sleep well probably my health was a little disordered i was oppressed with perplexity and doubt once or twice i had a feeling of intense fear for which i could perceive no definite reason i remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight that night weena was among them and feeling reassured by their presence it occurred to me even then that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its last quarter and the nights grow dark when the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below these whitened lemurs this new vermin that had replaced the old might be more abundant and on both these days i had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty i felt assured that the time machine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these underground mysteries yet i could not face the mystery if only i had had a companion it would have been different but i was so horribly alone and even to clamber down into the darkness of the well appalled me i don t know if you will understand my feeling but i never felt quite safe at my back it was this restlessness this insecurity perhaps that drove me further and further afield in my exploring expeditions going to the south westward towards the rising country that is now called combe wood i observed far off in the direction of nineteenth century banstead a vast green structure different in character from any i had hitherto seen it was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins i knew and the facade had an oriental look the face of it having the lustre as well as the pale green tint a kind of bluish green of a certain type of chinese porcelain this difference in aspect suggested a difference in use and i was minded to push on and explore but the day was growing late and i had come upon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit so i resolved to hold over the adventure for the following day and i returned to the welcome and the caresses of little weena but next morning i perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the palace of green porcelain was a piece of self deception to enable me to shirk by another day an experience i dreaded i resolved i would make the descent without further waste of time and started out in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite and aluminium little weena ran with me she danced beside me to the well but when she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward she seemed strangely disconcerted good bye little weena i said kissing her and then putting her down i began to feel over the parapet for the climbing hooks rather hastily i may as well confess for i feared my courage might leak away at first she watched me in amazement then she gave a most piteous cry and running to me she began to pull at me with her little hands i think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed i shook her off perhaps a little roughly and in another moment i was in the throat of the well i saw her agonized face over the parapet and smiled to reassure her then i had to look down at the unstable hooks to which i clung i had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards the descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides of the well and these being adapted to the needs of a creature much smaller and lighter than myself i was speedily cramped and fatigued by the descent and not simply fatigued one of the bars bent suddenly under my weight and almost swung me off into the blackness beneath for a moment i hung by one hand and after that experience i did not dare to rest again though my arms and back were presently acutely painful i went on clambering down the sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible glancing upward i saw the aperture a small blue disk in which a star was visible while little weena s head showed as a round black projection the thudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive everything save that little disk above was profoundly dark and when i looked up again weena had disappeared i was in an agony of discomfort i had some thought of trying to go up the shaft again and leave the under world alone but even while i turned this over in my mind i continued to descend at last with intense relief i saw dimly coming up a foot to the right of me a slender loophole in the wall swinging myself in i found it was the aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which i could lie down and rest it was not too soon my arms ached my back was cramped and i was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall besides this the unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes the air was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft i do not know how long i lay i was roused by a soft hand touching my face starting up in the darkness i snatched at my matches and hastily striking one i saw three stooping white creatures similar to the one i had seen above ground in the ruin hastily retreating before the light living as they did in what appeared to me impenetrable darkness their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes and they reflected the light in the same way i have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light but so soon as i struck a match in order to see them they fled incontinently vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion i tried to call to them but the language they had was apparently different from that of the over world people so that i was needs left to my own unaided efforts and the thought of flight before exploration was even then in my mind but i said to myself you are in for it now and feeling my way along the tunnel i found the noise of machinery grow louder presently the walls fell away from me and i came to a large open space and striking another match saw that i had entered a vast arched cavern which stretched into utter darkness beyond the range of my light the view i had of it was as much as one could see in the burning of a match necessarily my memory is vague great shapes like big machines rose out of the dimness and cast grotesque black shadows in which dim spectral morlocks sheltered from the glare the place by the by was very stuffy and oppressive and the faint halitus of freshly shed blood was in the air some way down the central vista was a little table of white metal laid with what seemed a meal the morlocks at any rate were carnivorous even at the time i remember wondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red joint i saw it was all very indistinct the heavy smell the big unmeaning shapes the obscene figures lurking in the shadows and only waiting for the darkness to come at me again then the match burned down and stung my fingers and fell a wriggling red spot in the blackness i have thought since how particularly ill equipped i was for such an experience when i had started with the time machine i had started with the absurd assumption that the men of the future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances i had come without arms without medicine without anything to smoke at times i missed tobacco frightfully even without enough matches if only i had thought of a kodak i could have flashed that glimpse of the underworld in a second and examined it at leisure but as it was i stood there with only the weapons and the powers that nature had endowed me with hands feet and teeth these and four safety matches that still remained to me i was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark and it was only with my last glimpse of light i discovered that my store of matches had run low it had never occurred to me until that moment that there was any need to economize them and i had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the upper worlders to whom fire was a novelty now as i say i had four left and while i stood in the dark a hand touched mine lank fingers came feeling over my face and i was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour i fancied i heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me i felt the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing the sense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably unpleasant the sudden realization of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness i shouted at them as loudly as i could they started away and then i could feel them approaching me again they clutched at me more boldly whispering odd sounds to each other i shivered violently and shouted again rather discordantly this time they were not so seriously alarmed and they made a queer laughing noise as they came back at me i will confess i was horribly frightened i determined to strike another match and escape under the protection of its glare i did so and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper from my pocket i made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel but i had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the blackness i could hear the morlocks rustling like wind among leaves and pattering like the rain as they hurried after me in a moment i was clutched by several hands and there was no mistaking that they were trying to haul me back i struck another light and waved it in their dazzled faces you can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked those pale chinless faces and great lidless pinkish grey eyes as they stared in their blindness and bewilderment but i did not stay to look i promise you i retreated again and when my second match had ended i struck my third it had almost burned through when i reached the opening into the shaft i lay down on the edge for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy then i felt sideways for the projecting hooks and as i did so my feet were grasped from behind and i was violently tugged backward i lit my last match and it incontinently went out but i had my hand on the climbing bars now and kicking violently i disengaged myself from the clutches of the morlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft while they stayed peering and blinking up at me all but one little wretch who followed me for some way and well nigh secured my boot as a trophy that climb seemed interminable to me with the last twenty or thirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me i had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold the last few yards was a frightful struggle against this faintness several times my head swam and i felt all the sensations of falling at last however i got over the well mouth somehow and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight i fell upon my face even the soil smelt sweet and clean then i remember weena kissing my hands and ears and the voices of others among the eloi then for a time i was insensible vii now indeed i seemed in a worse case than before hitherto except during my night s anguish at the loss of the time machine i had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape but that hope was staggered by these new discoveries hitherto i had merely thought myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people and by some unknown forces which i had only to understand to overcome but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of the morlocks a something inhuman and malign instinctively i loathed them before i had felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it now i felt like a beast in a trap whose enemy would come upon him soon the enemy i dreaded may surprise you it was the darkness of the new moon weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible remarks about the dark nights it was not now such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming dark nights might mean the moon was on the wane each night there was a longer interval of darkness and i now understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear of the little upper world people for the dark i wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that the morlocks did under the new moon i felt pretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong the upper world people might once have been the favoured aristocracy and the morlocks their mechanical servants but that had long since passed away the two species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down towards or had already arrived at an altogether new relationship the eloi like the carolingian kings had decayed to a mere beautiful futility they still possessed the earth on sufferance since the morlocks subterranean for innumerable generations had come at last to find the daylit surface intolerable and the morlocks made their garments i inferred and maintained them in their habitual needs perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service they did it as a standing horse paws with his foot or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the organism but clearly the old order was already in part reversed the nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace ages ago thousands of generations ago man had thrust his brother man out of the ease and the sunshine and now that brother was coming back changed already the eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew they were becoming reacquainted with fear and suddenly there came into my head the memory of the meat i had seen in the under world it seemed odd how it floated into my mind not stirred up as it were by the current of my meditations but coming in almost like a question from outside i tried to recall the form of it i had a vague sense of something familiar but i could not tell what it was at the time still however helpless the little people in the presence of their mysterious fear i was differently constituted i came out of this age of ours this ripe prime of the human race when fear does not paralyse and mystery has lost its terrors i at least would defend myself without further delay i determined to make myself arms and a fastness where i might sleep with that refuge as a base i could face this strange world with some of that confidence i had lost in realizing to what creatures night by night i lay exposed i felt i could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them i shuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined me i wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the thames but found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible all the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers as the morlocks to judge by their wells must be then the tall pinnacles of the palace of green porcelain and the polished gleam of its walls came back to my memory and in the evening taking weena like a child upon my shoulder i went up the hills towards the south west the distance i had reckoned was seven or eight miles but it must have been nearer eighteen i had first seen the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished in addition the heel of one of my shoes was loose and a nail was working through the sole they were comfortable old shoes i wore about indoors so that i was lame and it was already long past sunset when i came in sight of the palace silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky weena had been hugely delighted when i began to carry her but after a while she desired me to let her down and ran along by the side of me occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my pockets my pockets had always puzzled weena but at the last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vase for floral decoration at least she utilized them for that purpose and that reminds me in changing my jacket i found the time traveller paused put his hand into his pocket and silently placed two withered flowers not unlike very large white mallows upon the little table then he resumed his narrative as the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the hill crest towards wimbledon weena grew tired and wanted to return to the house of grey stone but i pointed out the distant pinnacles of the palace of green porcelain to her and contrived to make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her fear you know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk even the breeze stops in the trees to me there is always an air of expectation about that evening stillness the sky was clear remote and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the sunset well that night the expectation took the colour of my fears in that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally sharpened i fancied i could even feel the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet could indeed almost see through it the morlocks on their ant hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark in my excitement i fancied that they would receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war and why had they taken my time machine so we went on in the quiet and the twilight deepened into night the clear blue of the distance faded and one star after another came out the ground grew dim and the trees black weena s fears and her fatigue grew upon her i took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed her then as the darkness grew deeper she put her arms round my neck and closing her eyes tightly pressed her face against my shoulder so we went down a long slope into a valley and there in the dimness i almost walked into a little river this i waded and went up the opposite side of the valley past a number of sleeping houses and by a statue a faun or some such figure minus the head here too were acacias so far i had seen nothing of the morlocks but it was yet early in the night and the darker hours before the old moon rose were still to come from the brow of the next hill i saw a thick wood spreading wide and black before me i hesitated at this i could see no end to it either to the right or the left feeling tired my feet in particular were very sore i carefully lowered weena from my shoulder as i halted and sat down upon the turf i could no longer see the palace of green porcelain and i was in doubt of my direction i looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide under that dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars even were there no other lurking danger a danger i did not care to let my imagination loose upon there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the tree boles to strike against i was very tired too after the excitements of the day so i decided that i would not face it but would pass the night upon the open hill weena i was glad to find was fast asleep i carefully wrapped her in my jacket and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise the hill side was quiet and deserted but from the black of the wood there came now and then a stir of living things above me shone the stars for the night was very clear i felt a certain sense of friendly comfort in their twinkling all the old constellations had gone from the sky however that slow movement which is imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings but the milky way it seemed to me was still the same tattered streamer of star dust as of yore southward as i judged it was a very bright red star that was new to me it was even more splendid than our own green sirius and amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the gravities of terrestrial life i thought of their unfathomable distance and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the unknown past into the unknown future i thought of the great precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes only forty times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that i had traversed and during these few revolutions all the activity all the traditions the complex organizations the nations languages literatures aspirations even the mere memory of man as i knew him had been swept out of existence instead were these frail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry and the white things of which i went in terror then i thought of the great fear that was between the two species and for the first time with a sudden shiver came the clear knowledge of what the meat i had seen might be yet it was too horrible i looked at little weena sleeping beside me her face white and starlike under the stars and forthwith dismissed the thought through that long night i held my mind off the morlocks as well as i could and whiled away the time by trying to fancy i could find signs of the old constellations in the new confusion the sky kept very clear except for a hazy cloud or so no doubt i dozed at times then as my vigil wore on came a faintness in the eastward sky like the reflection of some colourless fire and the old moon rose thin and peaked and white and close behind and overtaking it and overflowing it the dawn came pale at first and then growing pink and warm no morlocks had approached us indeed i had seen none upon the hill that night and in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable i stood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel so i sat down again took off my shoes and flung them away i awakened weena and we went down into the wood now green and pleasant instead of black and forbidding we found some fruit wherewith to break our fast we soon met others of the dainty ones laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as the night and then i thought once more of the meat that i had seen i felt assured now of what it was and from the bottom of my heart i pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity clearly at some time in the long ago of human decay the morlocks food had run short possibly they had lived on rats and such like vermin even now man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he was far less than any monkey his prejudice against human flesh is no deep seated instinct and so these inhuman sons of men i tried to look at the thing in a scientific spirit after all they were less human and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago and the intelligence that would have made this state of things a torment had gone why should i trouble myself these eloi were mere fatted cattle which the ant like morlocks preserved and preyed upon probably saw to the breeding of and there was weena dancing at my side then i tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon me by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness man had been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his fellow man had taken necessity as his watchword and excuse and in the fullness of time necessity had come home to him i even tried a carlyle like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay but this attitude of mind was impossible however great their intellectual degradation the eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim my sympathy and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and their fear i had at that time very vague ideas as to the course i should pursue my first was to secure some safe place of refuge and to make myself such arms of metal or stone as i could contrive that necessity was immediate in the next place i hoped to procure some means of fire so that i should have the weapon of a torch at hand for nothing i knew would be more efficient against these morlocks then i wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the white sphinx i had in mind a battering ram i had a persuasion that if i could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me i should discover the time machine and escape i could not imagine the morlocks were strong enough to move it far away weena i had resolved to bring with me to our own time and turning such schemes over in my mind i pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling viii i found the palace of green porcelain when we approached it about noon deserted and falling into ruin only ragged vestiges of glass remained in its windows and great sheets of the green facing had fallen away from the corroded metallic framework it lay very high upon a turfy down and looking north eastward before i entered it i was surprised to see a large estuary or even creek where i judged wandsworth and battersea must once have been i thought then though i never followed up the thought of what might have happened or might be happening to the living things in the sea the material of the palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain and along the face of it i saw an inscription in some unknown character i thought rather foolishly that weena might help me to interpret this but i only learned that the bare idea of writing had never entered her head she always seemed to me i fancy more human than she was perhaps because her affection was so human within the big valves of the door which were open and broken we found instead of the customary hall a long gallery lit by many side windows at the first glance i was reminded of a museum the tiled floor was thick with dust and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering then i perceived standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall what was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton i recognized by the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the fashion of the megatherium the skull and the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust and in one place where rain water had dropped through a leak in the roof the thing itself had been worn away further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a brontosaurus my museum hypothesis was confirmed going towards the side i found what appeared to be sloping shelves and clearing away the thick dust i found the old familiar glass cases of our own time but they must have been air tight to judge from the fair preservation of some of their contents clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter day south kensington here apparently was the palaeontological section and a very splendid array of fossils it must have been though the inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time and had through the extinction of bacteria and fungi lost ninety nine hundredths of its force was nevertheless with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures here and there i found traces of the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds and the cases had in some instances been bodily removed by the morlocks as i judged the place was very silent the thick dust deadened our footsteps weena who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case presently came as i stared about me and very quietly took my hand and stood beside me and at first i was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an intellectual age that i gave no thought to the possibilities it presented even my preoccupation about the time machine receded a little from my mind to judge from the size of the place this palace of green porcelain had a great deal more in it than a gallery of palaeontology possibly historical galleries it might be even a library to me at least in my present circumstances these would be vastly more interesting than this spectacle of oldtime geology in decay exploring i found another short gallery running transversely to the first this appeared to be devoted to minerals and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder but i could find no saltpeter indeed no nitrates of any kind doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago yet the sulphur hung in my mind and set up a train of thinking as for the rest of the contents of that gallery though on the whole they were the best preserved of all i saw i had little interest i am no specialist in mineralogy and i went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall i had entered apparently this section had been devoted to natural history but everything had long since passed out of recognition a few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed animals desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit a brown dust of departed plants that was all i was sorry for that because i should have been glad to trace the patent readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been attained then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions but singularly ill lit the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the end at which i entered at intervals white globes hung from the ceiling many of them cracked and smashed which suggested that originally the place had been artificially lit here i was more in my element for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big machines all greatly corroded and many broken down but some still fairly complete you know i have a certain weakness for mechanism and i was inclined to linger among these the more so as for the most part they had the interest of puzzles and i could make only the vaguest guesses at what they were for i fancied that if i could solve their puzzles i should find myself in possession of powers that might be of use against the morlocks suddenly weena came very close to my side so suddenly that she startled me had it not been for her i do not think i should have noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all footnote it may be of course that the floor did not slope but that the museum was built into the side of a hill ed the end i had come in at was quite above ground and was lit by rare slit like windows as you went down the length the ground came up against these windows until at last there was a pit like the area of a london house before each and only a narrow line of daylight at the top i went slowly along puzzling about the machines and had been too intent upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light until weena s increasing apprehensions drew my attention then i saw that the gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness i hesitated and then as i looked round me i saw that the dust was less abundant and its surface less even further away towards the dimness it appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints my sense of the immediate presence of the morlocks revived at that i felt that i was wasting my time in the academic examination of machinery i called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon and that i had still no weapon no refuge and no means of making a fire and then down in the remote blackness of the gallery i heard a peculiar pattering and the same odd noises i had heard down the well i took weena s hand then struck with a sudden idea i left her and turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a signal box clambering upon the stand and grasping this lever in my hands i put all my weight upon it sideways suddenly weena deserted in the central aisle began to whimper i had judged the strength of the lever pretty correctly for it snapped after a minute s strain and i rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient i judged for any morlock skull i might encounter and i longed very much to kill a morlock or so very inhuman you may think to want to go killing one s own descendants but it was impossible somehow to feel any humanity in the things only my disinclination to leave weena and a persuasion that if i began to slake my thirst for murder my time machine might suffer restrained me from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes i heard well mace in one hand and weena in the other i went out of that gallery and into another and still larger one which at the first glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags the brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it i presently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books they had long since dropped to pieces and every semblance of print had left them but here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the tale well enough had i been a literary man i might perhaps have moralized upon the futility of all ambition but as it was the thing that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified at the time i will confess that i thought chiefly of the philosophical transactions and my own seventeen papers upon physical optics then going up a broad staircase we came to what may once have been a gallery of technical chemistry and here i had not a little hope of useful discoveries except at one end where the roof had collapsed this gallery was well preserved i went eagerly to every unbroken case and at last in one of the really air tight cases i found a box of matches very eagerly i tried them they were perfectly good they were not even damp i turned to weena dance i cried to her in her own tongue for now i had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared and so in that derelict museum upon the thick soft carpeting of dust to weena s huge delight i solemnly performed a kind of composite dance whistling the land of the leal as cheerfully as i could in part it was a modest cancan in part a step dance in part a skirt dance so far as my tail coat permitted and in part original for i am naturally inventive as you know now i still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange as for me it was a most fortunate thing yet oddly enough i found a far unlikelier substance and that was camphor i found it in a sealed jar that by chance i suppose had been really hermetically sealed i fancied at first that it was paraffin wax and smashed the glass accordingly but the odour of camphor was unmistakable in the universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive perhaps through many thousands of centuries it reminded me of a sepia painting i had once seen done from the ink of a fossil belemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millions of years ago i was about to throw it away but i remembered that it was inflammable and burned with a good bright flame was in fact an excellent candle and i put it in my pocket i found no explosives however nor any means of breaking down the bronze doors as yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing i had chanced upon nevertheless i left that gallery greatly elated i cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon it would require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all the proper order i remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms and how i hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword i could not carry both however and my bar of iron promised best against the bronze gates there were numbers of guns pistols and rifles the most were masses of rust but many were of some new metal and still fairly sound but any cartridges or powder there may once have been had rotted into dust one corner i saw was charred and shattered perhaps i thought by an explosion among the specimens in another place was a vast array of idols polynesian mexican grecian phoenician every country on earth i should think and here yielding to an irresistible impulse i wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from south america that particularly took my fancy as the evening drew on my interest waned i went through gallery after gallery dusty silent often ruinous the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of rust and lignite sometimes fresher in one place i suddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine and then by the merest accident i discovered in an air tight case two dynamite cartridges i shouted eureka and smashed the case with joy then came a doubt i hesitated then selecting a little side gallery i made my essay i never felt such a disappointment as i did in waiting five ten fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came of course the things were dummies as i might have guessed from their presence i really believe that had they not been so i should have rushed off incontinently and blown sphinx bronze doors and as it proved my chances of finding the time machine all together into non existence it was after that i think that we came to a little open court within the palace it was turfed and had three fruit trees so we rested and refreshed ourselves towards sunset i began to consider our position night was creeping upon us and my inaccessible hiding place had still to be found but that troubled me very little now i had in my possession a thing that was perhaps the best of all defences against the morlocks i had matches i had the camphor in my pocket too if a blaze were needed it seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open protected by a fire in the morning there was the getting of the time machine towards that as yet i had only my iron mace but now with my growing knowledge i felt very differently towards those bronze doors up to this i had refrained from forcing them largely because of the mystery on the other side they had never impressed me as being very strong and i hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the work ix we emerged from the palace while the sun was still in part above the horizon i was determined to reach the white sphinx early the next morning and ere the dusk i purposed pushing through the woods that had stopped me on the previous journey my plan was to go as far as possible that night and then building a fire to sleep in the protection of its glare accordingly as we went along i gathered any sticks or dried grass i saw and presently had my arms full of such litter thus loaded our progress was slower than i had anticipated and besides weena was tired and i began to suffer from sleepiness too so that it was full night before we reached the wood upon the shrubby hill of its edge weena would have stopped fearing the darkness before us but a singular sense of impending calamity that should indeed have served me as a warning drove me onward i had been without sleep for a night and two days and i was feverish and irritable i felt sleep coming upon me and the morlocks with it while we hesitated among the black bushes behind us and dim against their blackness i saw three crouching figures there was scrub and long grass all about us and i did not feel safe from their insidious approach the forest i calculated was rather less than a mile across if we could get through it to the bare hill side there as it seemed to me was an altogether safer resting place i thought that with my matches and my camphor i could contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods yet it was evident that if i was to flourish matches with my hands i should have to abandon my firewood so rather reluctantly i put it down and then it came into my head that i would amaze our friends behind by lighting it i was to discover the atrocious folly of this proceeding but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering our retreat i don t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be in the absence of man and in a temperate climate the sun s heat is rarely strong enough to burn even when it is focused by dewdrops as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts lightning may blast and blacken but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation but this rarely results in flame in this decadence too the art of fire making had been forgotten on the earth the red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to weena she wanted to run to it and play with it i believe she would have cast herself into it had i not restrained her but i caught her up and in spite of her struggles plunged boldly before me into the wood for a little way the glare of my fire lit the path looking back presently i could see through the crowded stems that from my heap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent and a curved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill i laughed at that and turned again to the dark trees before me it was very black and weena clung to me convulsively but there was still as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness sufficient light for me to avoid the stems overhead it was simply black except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there i struck none of my matches because i had no hand free upon my left arm i carried my little one in my right hand i had my iron bar for some way i heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet the faint rustle of the breeze above and my own breathing and the throb of the blood vessels in my ears then i seemed to know of a pattering about me i pushed on grimly the pattering grew more distinct and then i caught the same queer sound and voices i had heard in the under world there were evidently several of the morlocks and they were closing in upon me indeed in another minute i felt a tug at my coat then something at my arm and weena shivered violently and became quite still it was time for a match but to get one i must put her down i did so and as i fumbled with my pocket a struggle began in the darkness about my knees perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar cooing sounds from the morlocks soft little hands too were creeping over my coat and back touching even my neck then the match scratched and fizzed i held it flaring and saw the white backs of the morlocks in flight amid the trees i hastily took a lump of camphor from my pocket and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane then i looked at weena she was lying clutching my feet and quite motionless with her face to the ground with a sudden fright i stooped to her she seemed scarcely to breathe i lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground and as it split and flared up and drove back the morlocks and the shadows i knelt down and lifted her the wood behind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great company she seemed to have fainted i put her carefully upon my shoulder and rose to push on and then there came a horrible realization in manoeuvring with my matches and weena i had turned myself about several times and now i had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my path for all i knew i might be facing back towards the palace of green porcelain i found myself in a cold sweat i had to think rapidly what to do i determined to build a fire and encamp where we were i put weena still motionless down upon a turfy bole and very hastily as my first lump of camphor waned i began collecting sticks and leaves here and there out of the darkness round me the morlocks eyes shone like carbuncles the camphor flickered and went out i lit a match and as i did so two white forms that had been approaching weena dashed hastily away one was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me and i felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist he gave a whoop of dismay staggered a little way and fell down i lit another piece of camphor and went on gathering my bonfire presently i noticed how dry was some of the foliage above me for since my arrival on the time machine a matter of a week no rain had fallen so instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs i began leaping up and dragging down branches very soon i had a choking smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks and could economize my camphor then i turned to where weena lay beside my iron mace i tried what i could to revive her but she lay like one dead i could not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed now the smoke of the fire beat over towards me and it must have made me heavy of a sudden moreover the vapour of camphor was in the air my fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so i felt very weary after my exertion and sat down the wood too was full of a slumbrous murmur that i did not understand i seemed just to nod and open my eyes but all was dark and the morlocks had their hands upon me flinging off their clinging fingers i hastily felt in my pocket for the match box and it had gone then they gripped and closed with me again in a moment i knew what had happened i had slept and my fire had gone out and the bitterness of death came over my soul the forest seemed full of the smell of burning wood i was caught by the neck by the hair by the arms and pulled down it was indescribably horrible in the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me i felt as if i was in a monstrous spider s web i was overpowered and went down i felt little teeth nipping at my neck i rolled over and as i did so my hand came against my iron lever it gave me strength i struggled up shaking the human rats from me and holding the bar short i thrust where i judged their faces might be i could feel the succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows and for a moment i was free the strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting came upon me i knew that both i and weena were lost but i determined to make the morlocks pay for their meat i stood with my back to a tree swinging the iron bar before me the whole wood was full of the stir and cries of them a minute passed their voices seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement and their movements grew faster yet none came within reach i stood glaring at the blackness then suddenly came hope what if the morlocks were afraid and close on the heels of that came a strange thing the darkness seemed to grow luminous very dimly i began to see the morlocks about me three battered at my feet and then i recognized with incredulous surprise that the others were running in an incessant stream as it seemed from behind me and away through the wood in front and their backs seemed no longer white but reddish as i stood agape i saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight between the branches and vanish and at that i understood the smell of burning wood the slumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar the red glow and the morlocks flight stepping out from behind my tree and looking back i saw through the black pillars of the nearer trees the flames of the burning forest it was my first fire coming after me with that i looked for weena but she was gone the hissing and crackling behind me the explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame left little time for reflection my iron bar still gripped i followed in the morlocks path it was a close race once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as i ran that i was outflanked and had to strike off to the left but at last i emerged upon a small open space and as i did so a morlock came blundering towards me and past me and went on straight into the fire and now i was to see the most weird and horrible thing i think of all that i beheld in that future age this whole space was as bright as day with the reflection of the fire in the centre was a hillock or tumulus surmounted by a scorched hawthorn beyond this was another arm of the burning forest with yellow tongues already writhing from it completely encircling the space with a fence of fire upon the hill side were some thirty or forty morlocks dazzled by the light and heat and blundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment at first i did not realize their blindness and struck furiously at them with my bar in a frenzy of fear as they approached me killing one and crippling several more but when i had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky and heard their moans i was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare and i struck no more of them yet every now and then one would come straight towards me setting loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him at one time the flames died down somewhat and i feared the foul creatures would presently be able to see me i was thinking of beginning the fight by killing some of them before this should happen but the fire burst out again brightly and i stayed my hand i walked about the hill among them and avoided them looking for some trace of weena but weena was gone at last i sat down on the summit of the hillock and watched this strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro and making uncanny noises to each other as the glare of the fire beat on them the coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky and through the rare tatters of that red canopy remote as though they belonged to another universe shone the little stars two or three morlocks came blundering into me and i drove them off with blows of my fists trembling as i did so for the most part of that night i was persuaded it was a nightmare i bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake i beat the ground with my hands and got up and sat down again and wandered here and there and again sat down then i would fall to rubbing my eyes and calling upon god to let me awake thrice i saw morlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the flames but at last above the subsiding red of the fire above the streaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures came the white light of the day i searched again for traces of weena but there were none it was plain that they had left her poor little body in the forest i cannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate to which it seemed destined as i thought of that i was almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me but i contained myself the hillock as i have said was a kind of island in the forest from its summit i could now make out through a haze of smoke the palace of green porcelain and from that i could get my bearings for the white sphinx and so leaving the remnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and moaning as the day grew clearer i tied some grass about my feet and limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems that still pulsated internally with fire towards the hiding place of the time machine i walked slowly for i was almost exhausted as well as lame and i felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death of little weena it seemed an overwhelming calamity now in this old familiar room it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss but that morning it left me absolutely lonely again terribly alone i began to think of this house of mine of this fireside of some of you and with such thoughts came a longing that was pain but as i walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky i made a discovery in my trouser pocket were still some loose matches the box must have leaked before it was lost x about eight or nine in the morning i came to the same seat of yellow metal from which i had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival i thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and could not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence here was the same beautiful scene the same abundant foliage the same splendid palaces and magnificent ruins the same silver river running between its fertile banks the gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and thither among the trees some were bathing in exactly the place where i had saved weena and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain and like blots upon the landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the under world i understood now what all the beauty of the over world people covered very pleasant was their day as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field like the cattle they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs and their end was the same i grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had been it had committed suicide it had set itself steadfastly towards comfort and ease a balanced society with security and permanency as its watchword it had attained its hopes to come to this at last once life and property must have reached almost absolute safety the rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort the toiler assured of his life and work no doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem no social question left unsolved and a great quiet had followed it is a law of nature we overlook that intellectual versatility is the compensation for change danger and trouble an animal perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless there is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change only those animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety of needs and dangers so as i see it the upper world man had drifted towards his feeble prettiness and the under world to mere mechanical industry but that perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical perfection absolute permanency apparently as time went on the feeding of the under world however it was effected had become disjointed mother necessity who had been staved off for a few thousand years came back again and she began below the under world being in contact with machinery which however perfect still needs some little thought outside habit had probably retained perforce rather more initiative if less of every other human character than the upper and when other meat failed them they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden so i say i saw it in my last view of the world of eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one it may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit could invent it is how the thing shaped itself to me and as that i give it to you after the fatigues excitements and terrors of the past days and in spite of my grief this seat and the tranquil view and the warm sunlight were very pleasant i was very tired and sleepy and soon my theorizing passed into dozing catching myself at that i took my own hint and spreading myself out upon the turf i had a long and refreshing sleep i awoke a little before sunsetting i now felt safe against being caught napping by the morlocks and stretching myself i came on down the hill towards the white sphinx i had my crowbar in one hand and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket and now came a most unexpected thing as i approached the pedestal of the sphinx i found the bronze valves were open they had slid down into grooves at that i stopped short before them hesitating to enter within was a small apartment and on a raised place in the corner of this was the time machine i had the small levers in my pocket so here after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the white sphinx was a meek surrender i threw my iron bar away almost sorry not to use it a sudden thought came into my head as i stooped towards the portal for once at least i grasped the mental operations of the morlocks suppressing a strong inclination to laugh i stepped through the bronze frame and up to the time machine i was surprised to find it had been carefully oiled and cleaned i have suspected since that the morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose now as i stood and examined it finding a pleasure in the mere touch of the contrivance the thing i had expected happened the bronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang i was in the dark trapped so the morlocks thought at that i chuckled gleefully i could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me very calmly i tried to strike the match i had only to fix on the levers and depart then like a ghost but i had overlooked one little thing the matches were of that abominable kind that light only on the box you may imagine how all my calm vanished the little brutes were close upon me one touched me i made a sweeping blow in the dark at them with the levers and began to scramble into the saddle of the machine then came one hand upon me and then another then i had simply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers and at the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted one indeed they almost got away from me as it slipped from my hand i had to butt in the dark with my head i could hear the morlock s skull ring to recover it it was a nearer thing than the fight in the forest i think this last scramble but at last the lever was fitted and pulled over the clinging hands slipped from me the darkness presently fell from my eyes i found myself in the same grey light and tumult i have already described xi i have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with time travelling and this time i was not seated properly in the saddle but sideways and in an unstable fashion for an indefinite time i clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated quite unheeding how i went and when i brought myself to look at the dials again i was amazed to find where i had arrived one dial records days and another thousands of days another millions of days and another thousands of millions now instead of reversing the levers i had pulled them over so as to go forward with them and when i came to look at these indicators i found that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch into futurity as i drove on a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things the palpitating greyness grew darker then though i was still travelling with prodigious velocity the blinking succession of day and night which was usually indicative of a slower pace returned and grew more and more marked this puzzled me very much at first the alternations of night and day grew slower and slower and so did the passage of the sun across the sky until they seemed to stretch through centuries at last a steady twilight brooded over the earth a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky the band of light that had indicated the sun had long since disappeared for the sun had ceased to set it simply rose and fell in the west and grew ever broader and more red all trace of the moon had vanished the circling of the stars growing slower and slower had given place to creeping points of light at last some time before i stopped the sun red and very large halted motionless upon the horizon a vast dome glowing with a dull heat and now and then suffering a momentary extinction at one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat i perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal drag was done the earth had come to rest with one face to the sun even as in our own time the moon faces the earth very cautiously for i remembered my former headlong fall i began to reverse my motion slower and slower went the circling hands until the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a mere mist upon its scale still slower until the dim outlines of a desolate beach grew visible i stopped very gently and sat upon the time machine looking round the sky was no longer blue north eastward it was inky black and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars overhead it was a deep indian red and starless and south eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where cut by the horizon lay the huge hull of the sun red and motionless the rocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour and all the trace of life that i could see at first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting point on their south eastern face it was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves plants which like these grow in a perpetual twilight the machine was standing on a sloping beach the sea stretched away to the south west to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky there were no breakers and no waves for not a breath of wind was stirring only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living and along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of salt pink under the lurid sky there was a sense of oppression in my head and i noticed that i was breathing very fast the sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering and from that i judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now far away up the desolate slope i heard a harsh scream and saw a thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and circling disappear over some low hillocks beyond the sound of its voice was so dismal that i shivered and seated myself more firmly upon the machine looking round me again i saw that quite near what i had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me then i saw the thing was really a monstrous crab like creature can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly its big claws swaying its long antennae like carters whips waving and feeling and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic front its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there i could see the many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it moved as i stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me i felt a tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there i tried to brush it away with my hand but in a moment it returned and almost immediately came another by my ear i struck at this and caught something threadlike it was drawn swiftly out of my hand with a frightful qualm i turned and i saw that i had grasped the antenna of another monster crab that stood just behind me its evil eyes were wriggling on their stalks its mouth was all alive with appetite and its vast ungainly claws smeared with an algal slime were descending upon me in a moment my hand was on the lever and i had placed a month between myself and these monsters but i was still on the same beach and i saw them distinctly now as soon as i stopped dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there in the sombre light among the foliated sheets of intense green i cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the world the red eastern sky the northward blackness the salt dead sea the stony beach crawling with these foul slow stirring monsters the uniform poisonous looking green of the lichenous plants the thin air that hurts one s lungs all contributed to an appalling effect i moved on a hundred years and there was the same red sun a little larger a little duller the same dying sea the same chill air and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and the red rocks and in the westward sky i saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon so i travelled stopping ever and again in great strides of a thousand years or more drawn on by the mystery of the earth s fate watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in the westward sky and the life of the old earth ebb away at last more than thirty million years hence the huge red hot dome of the sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens then i stopped once more for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared and the red beach save for its livid green liverworts and lichens seemed lifeless and now it was flecked with white a bitter cold assailed me rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down to the north eastward the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable sky and i could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white there were fringes of ice along the sea margin with drifting masses further out but the main expanse of that salt ocean all bloody under the eternal sunset was still unfrozen i looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained a certain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the machine but i saw nothing moving in earth or sky or sea the green slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct a shallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the beach i fancied i saw some black object flopping about upon this bank but it became motionless as i looked at it and i judged that my eye had been deceived and that the black object was merely a rock the stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very little suddenly i noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had changed that a concavity a bay had appeared in the curve i saw this grow larger for a minute perhaps i stared aghast at this blackness that was creeping over the day and then i realized that an eclipse was beginning either the moon or the planet mercury was passing across the sun s disk naturally at first i took it to be the moon but there is much to incline me to believe that what i really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to the earth the darkness grew apace a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from the east and the showering white flakes in the air increased in number from the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent silent it would be hard to convey the stillness of it all the sounds of man the bleating of sheep the cries of birds the hum of insects the stir that makes the background of our lives all that was over as the darkness thickened the eddying flakes grew more abundant dancing before my eyes and the cold of the air more intense at last one by one swiftly one after the other the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into blackness the breeze rose to a moaning wind i saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me in another moment the pale stars alone were visible all else was rayless obscurity the sky was absolutely black a horror of this great darkness came on me the cold that smote to my marrow and the pain i felt in breathing overcame me i shivered and a deadly nausea seized me then like a red hot bow in the sky appeared the edge of the sun i got off the machine to recover myself i felt giddy and incapable of facing the return journey as i stood sick and confused i saw again the moving thing upon the shoal there was no mistake now that it was a moving thing against the red water of the sea it was a round thing the size of a football perhaps or it may be bigger and tentacles trailed down from it it seemed black against the weltering blood red water and it was hopping fitfully about then i felt i was fainting but a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote and awful twilight sustained me while i clambered upon the saddle xii so i came back for a long time i must have been insensible upon the machine the blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed the sun got golden again the sky blue i breathed with greater freedom the fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed the hands spun backward upon the dials at last i saw again the dim shadows of houses the evidences of decadent humanity these too changed and passed and others came presently when the million dial was at zero i slackened speed i began to recognize our own pretty and familiar architecture the thousands hand ran back to the starting point the night and day flapped slower and slower then the old walls of the laboratory came round me very gently now i slowed the mechanism down i saw one little thing that seemed odd to me i think i have told you that when i set out before my velocity became very high mrs watchett had walked across the room travelling as it seemed to me like a rocket as i returned i passed again across that minute when she traversed the laboratory but now her every motion appeared to be the exact inversion of her previous ones the door at the lower end opened and she glided quietly up the laboratory back foremost and disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered just before that i seemed to see hillyer for a moment but he passed like a flash then i stopped the machine and saw about me again the old familiar laboratory my tools my appliances just as i had left them i got off the thing very shakily and sat down upon my bench for several minutes i trembled violently then i became calmer around me was my old workshop again exactly as it had been i might have slept there and the whole thing have been a dream and yet not exactly the thing had started from the south east corner of the laboratory it had come to rest again in the north west against the wall where you saw it that gives you the exact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the white sphinx into which the morlocks had carried my machine for a time my brain went stagnant presently i got up and came through the passage here limping because my heel was still painful and feeling sorely begrimed i saw the pall mall gazette on the table by the door i found the date was indeed to day and looking at the timepiece saw the hour was almost eight o clock i heard your voices and the clatter of plates i hesitated i felt so sick and weak then i sniffed good wholesome meat and opened the door on you you know the rest i washed and dined and now i am telling you the story i know he said after a pause that all this will be absolutely incredible to you to me the one incredible thing is that i am here to night in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces and telling you these strange adventures he looked at the medical man no i cannot expect you to believe it take it as a lie or a prophecy say i dreamed it in the workshop consider i have been speculating upon the destinies of our race until i have hatched this fiction treat my assertion of its truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest and taking it as a story what do you think of it he took up his pipe and began in his old accustomed manner to tap with it nervously upon the bars of the grate there was a momentary stillness then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the carpet i took my eyes off the time traveller s face and looked round at his audience they were in the dark and little spots of colour swam before them the medical man seemed absorbed in the contemplation of our host the editor was looking hard at the end of his cigar the sixth the journalist fumbled for his watch the others as far as i remember were motionless the editor stood up with a sigh what a pity it is you re not a writer of stories he said putting his hand on the time traveller s shoulder you don t believe it well i thought not the time traveller turned to us where are the matches he said he lit one and spoke over his pipe puffing to tell you the truth i hardly believe it myself and yet his eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon the little table then he turned over the hand holding his pipe and i saw he was looking at some half healed scars on his knuckles the medical man rose came to the lamp and examined the flowers the gynaeceum s odd he said the psychologist leant forward to see holding out his hand for a specimen i m hanged if it isn t a quarter to one said the journalist how shall we get home plenty of cabs at the station said the psychologist it s a curious thing said the medical man but i certainly don t know the natural order of these flowers may i have them the time traveller hesitated then suddenly certainly not where did you really get them said the medical man the time traveller put his hand to his head he spoke like one who was trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him they were put into my pocket by weena when i travelled into time he stared round the room i m damned if it isn t all going this room and you and the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory did i ever make a time machine or a model of a time machine or is it all only a dream they say life is a dream a precious poor dream at times but i can t stand another that won t fit it s madness and where did the dream come from i must look at that machine if there is one he caught up the lamp swiftly and carried it flaring red through the door into the corridor we followed him there in the flickering light of the lamp was the machine sure enough squat ugly and askew a thing of brass ebony ivory and translucent glimmering quartz solid to the touch for i put out my hand and felt the rail of it and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory and bits of grass and moss upon the lower parts and one rail bent awry the time traveller put the lamp down on the bench and ran his hand along the damaged rail it s all right now he said the story i told you was true i m sorry to have brought you out here in the cold he took up the lamp and in an absolute silence we returned to the smoking room he came into the hall with us and helped the editor on with his coat the medical man looked into his face and with a certain hesitation told him he was suffering from overwork at which he laughed hugely i remember him standing in the open doorway bawling good night i shared a cab with the editor he thought the tale a gaudy lie for my own part i was unable to come to a conclusion the story was so fantastic and incredible the telling so credible and sober i lay awake most of the night thinking about it i determined to go next day and see the time traveller again i was told he was in the laboratory and being on easy terms in the house i went up to him the laboratory however was empty i stared for a minute at the time machine and put out my hand and touched the lever at that the squat substantial looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind its instability startled me extremely and i had a queer reminiscence of the childish days when i used to be forbidden to meddle i came back through the corridor the time traveller met me in the smoking room he was coming from the house he had a small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other he laughed when he saw me and gave me an elbow to shake i m frightfully busy said he with that thing in there but is it not some hoax i said do you really travel through time really and truly i do and he looked frankly into my eyes he hesitated his eye wandered about the room i only want half an hour he said i know why you came and it s awfully good of you there s some magazines here if you ll stop to lunch i ll prove you this time travelling up to the hilt specimen and all if you ll forgive my leaving you now i consented hardly comprehending then the full import of his words and he nodded and went on down the corridor i heard the door of the laboratory slam seated myself in a chair and took up a daily paper what was he going to do before lunch time then suddenly i was reminded by an advertisement that i had promised to meet richardson the publisher at two i looked at my watch and saw that i could barely save that engagement i got up and went down the passage to tell the time traveller as i took hold of the handle of the door i heard an exclamation oddly truncated at the end and a click and a thud a gust of air whirled round me as i opened the door and from within came the sound of broken glass falling on the floor the time traveller was not there i seemed to see a ghostly indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black and brass for a moment a figure so transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct but this phantasm vanished as i rubbed my eyes the time machine had gone save for a subsiding stir of dust the further end of the laboratory was empty a pane of the skylight had apparently just been blown in i felt an unreasonable amazement i knew that something strange had happened and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing might be as i stood staring the door into the garden opened and the man servant appeared we looked at each other then ideas began to come has mr gone out that way said i no sir no one has come out this way i was expecting to find him here at that i understood at the risk of disappointing richardson i stayed on waiting for the time traveller waiting for the second perhaps still stranger story and the specimens and photographs he would bring with him but i am beginning now to fear that i must wait a lifetime the time traveller vanished three years ago and as everybody knows now he has never returned epilogue one cannot choose but wonder will he ever return it may be that he swept back into the past and fell among the blood drinking hairy savages of the age of unpolished stone into the abysses of the cretaceous sea or among the grotesque saurians the huge reptilian brutes of the jurassic times he may even now if i may use the phrase be wandering on some plesiosaurus haunted oolitic coral reef or beside the lonely saline lakes of the triassic age or did he go forward into one of the nearer ages in which men are still men but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome problems solved into the manhood of the race for i for my own part cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment fragmentary theory and mutual discord are indeed man s culminating time i say for my own part he i know for the question had been discussed among us long before the time machine was made thought but cheerlessly of the advancement of mankind and saw in the growing pile of civilization only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end if that is so it remains for us to live as though it were not so but to me the future is still black and blank is a vast ignorance lit at a few casual places by the memory of his story and i have by me for my comfort two strange white flowers shrivelled now and brown and flat and brittle to witness that even when mind and strength had gone gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of man \n"

              "'the time machine by h g wells i the time traveller for so it will be convenient to speak of him was expounding a recondite matter to us his grey eyes shone and twinkled and his usually pale face was flushed and animated the fire burned brightly and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses our chairs being his patents embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon and there was that luxurious after dinner atmosphere when thought roams gracefully free of the trammels of precision and he put it to us in this way marking the points with a lean forefinger as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox as we thought it and his fecundity you must follow me carefully i shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted the geometry for instance they taught you at school is founded on a misconception is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon said filby an argumentative person with red hair i do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it you will soon admit as much as i need from you you know of course that a mathematical line a line of thickness nil has no real existence they taught you that neither has a mathematical plane these things are mere abstractions that is all right said the psychologist nor having only length breadth and thickness can a cube have a real existence there i object said filby of course a solid body may exist all real things so most people think but wait a moment can an instantaneous cube exist don t follow you said filby can a cube that does not last for any time at all have a real existence filby became pensive clearly the time traveller proceeded any real body must have extension in four directions it must have length breadth thickness and duration but through a natural infirmity of the flesh which i will explain to you in a moment we incline to overlook this fact there are really four dimensions three which we call the three planes of space and a fourth time there is however a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives that said a very young man making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar over the lamp that very clear indeed now it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked continued the time traveller with a slight accession of cheerfulness really this is what is meant by the fourth dimension though some people who talk about the fourth dimension do not know they mean it it is only another way of looking at time there is no difference between time and any of the three dimensions of space except that our consciousness moves along it but some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea you have all heard what they have to say about this fourth dimension i have not said the provincial mayor it is simply this that space as our mathematicians have it is spoken of as having three dimensions which one may call length breadth and thickness and is always definable by reference to three planes each at right angles to the others but some philosophical people have been asking why three dimensions particularly why not another direction at right angles to the other three and have even tried to construct a four dimension geometry professor simon newcomb was expounding this to the new york mathematical society only a month or so ago you know how on a flat surface which has only two dimensions we can represent a figure of a three dimensional solid and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could represent one of four if they could master the perspective of the thing see i think so murmured the provincial mayor and knitting his brows he lapsed into an introspective state his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words yes i think i see it now he said after some time brightening in a quite transitory manner well i do not mind telling you i have been at work upon this geometry of four dimensions for some time some of my results are curious for instance here is a portrait of a man at eight years old another at fifteen another at seventeen another at twenty three and so on all these are evidently sections as it were three dimensional representations of his four dimensioned being which is a fixed and unalterable thing scientific people proceeded the time traveller after the pause required for the proper assimilation of this know very well that time is only a kind of space here is a popular scientific diagram a weather record this line i trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer yesterday it was so high yesterday night it fell then this morning it rose again and so gently upward to here surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of space generally recognized but certainly it traced such a line and that line therefore we must conclude was along the time dimension but said the medical man staring hard at a coal in the fire if time is really only a fourth dimension of space why is it and why has it always been regarded as something different and why cannot we move in time as we move about in the other dimensions of space the time traveller smiled are you sure we can move freely in space right and left we can go backward and forward freely enough and men always have done so i admit we move freely in two dimensions but how about up and down gravitation limits us there not exactly said the medical man there are balloons but before the balloons save for spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of the surface man had no freedom of vertical movement still they could move a little up and down said the medical man easier far easier down than up and you cannot move at all in time you cannot get away from the present moment my dear sir that is just where you are wrong that is just where the whole world has gone wrong we are always getting away from the present moment our mental existences which are immaterial and have no dimensions are passing along the time dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave just as we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth s surface but the great difficulty is this interrupted the psychologist you can move about in all directions of space but you cannot move about in time that is the germ of my great discovery but you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in time for instance if i am recalling an incident very vividly i go back to the instant of its occurrence i become absent minded as you say i jump back for a moment of course we have no means of staying back for any length of time any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground but a civilized man is better off than the savage in this respect he can go up against gravitation in a balloon and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the time dimension or even turn about and travel the other way oh this began filby is all why not said the time traveller it s against reason said filby what reason said the time traveller you can show black is white by argument said filby but you will never convince me possibly not said the time traveller but now you begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of four dimensions long ago i had a vague inkling of a machine to travel through time exclaimed the very young man that shall travel indifferently in any direction of space and time as the driver determines filby contented himself with laughter but i have experimental verification said the time traveller it would be remarkably convenient for the historian the psychologist suggested one might travel back and verify the accepted account of the battle of hastings for instance don t you think you would attract attention said the medical man our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms one might get one s greek from the very lips of homer and plato the very young man thought in which case they would certainly plough you for the little go the german scholars have improved greek so much then there is the future said the very young man just think one might invest all one s money leave it to accumulate at interest and hurry on ahead to discover a society said i erected on a strictly communistic basis of all the wild extravagant theories began the psychologist yes so it seemed to me and so i never talked of it until experimental verification cried i you are going to verify that the experiment cried filby who was getting brain weary let s see your experiment anyhow said the psychologist though it s all humbug you know the time traveller smiled round at us then still smiling faintly and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets he walked slowly out of the room and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory the psychologist looked at us i wonder what he s got some sleight of hand trick or other said the medical man and filby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at burslem but before he had finished his preface the time traveller came back and filby s anecdote collapsed the thing the time traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework scarcely larger than a small clock and very delicately made there was ivory in it and some transparent crystalline substance and now i must be explicit for this that follows unless his explanation is to be accepted is an absolutely unaccountable thing he took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room and set it in front of the fire with two legs on the hearthrug on this table he placed the mechanism then he drew up a chair and sat down the only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp the bright light of which fell upon the model there were also perhaps a dozen candles about two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces so that the room was brilliantly illuminated i sat in a low arm chair nearest the fire and i drew this forward so as to be almost between the time traveller and the fireplace filby sat behind him looking over his shoulder the medical man and the provincial mayor watched him in profile from the right the psychologist from the left the very young man stood behind the psychologist we were all on the alert it appears incredible to me that any kind of trick however subtly conceived and however adroitly done could have been played upon us under these conditions the time traveller looked at us and then at the mechanism well said the psychologist this little affair said the time traveller resting his elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus is only a model it is my plan for a machine to travel through time you will notice that it looks singularly askew and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar as though it was in some way unreal he pointed to the part with his finger also here is one little white lever and here is another the medical man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing it s beautifully made he said it took two years to make retorted the time traveller then when we had all imitated the action of the medical man he said now i want you clearly to understand that this lever being pressed over sends the machine gliding into the future and this other reverses the motion this saddle represents the seat of a time traveller presently i am going to press the lever and off the machine will go it will vanish pass into future time and disappear have a good look at the thing look at the table too and satisfy yourselves there is no trickery i don t want to waste this model and then be told i m a quack there was a minute s pause perhaps the psychologist seemed about to speak to me but changed his mind then the time traveller put forth his finger towards the lever no he said suddenly lend me your hand and turning to the psychologist he took that individual s hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger so that it was the psychologist himself who sent forth the model time machine on its interminable voyage we all saw the lever turn i am absolutely certain there was no trickery there was a breath of wind and the lamp flame jumped one of the candles on the mantel was blown out and the little machine suddenly swung round became indistinct was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory and it was gone vanished save for the lamp the table was bare everyone was silent for a minute then filby said he was damned the psychologist recovered from his stupor and suddenly looked under the table at that the time traveller laughed cheerfully well he said with a reminiscence of the psychologist then getting up he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel and with his back to us began to fill his pipe we stared at each other look here said the medical man are you in earnest about this do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time certainly said the time traveller stooping to light a spill at the fire then he turned lighting his pipe to look at the psychologist s face the psychologist to show that he was not unhinged helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut what is more i have a big machine nearly finished in there he indicated the laboratory and when that is put together i mean to have a journey on my own account you mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future said filby into the future or the past i don t for certain know which after an interval the psychologist had an inspiration it must have gone into the past if it has gone anywhere he said why said the time traveller because i presume that it has not moved in space and if it travelled into the future it would still be here all this time since it must have travelled through this time but i said if it travelled into the past it would have been visible when we came first into this room and last thursday when we were here and the thursday before that and so forth serious objections remarked the provincial mayor with an air of impartiality turning towards the time traveller not a bit said the time traveller and to the psychologist you think you can explain that it s presentation below the threshold you know diluted presentation of course said the psychologist and reassured us that s a simple point of psychology i should have thought of it it s plain enough and helps the paradox delightfully we cannot see it nor can we appreciate this machine any more than we can the spoke of a wheel spinning or a bullet flying through the air if it is travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are if it gets through a minute while we get through a second the impression it creates will of course be only one fiftieth or one hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in time that s plain enough he passed his hand through the space in which the machine had been you see he said laughing we sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so then the time traveller asked us what we thought of it all it sounds plausible enough to night said the medical man but wait until to morrow wait for the common sense of the morning would you like to see the time machine itself asked the time traveller and therewith taking the lamp in his hand he led the way down the long draughty corridor to his laboratory i remember vividly the flickering light his queer broad head in silhouette the dance of the shadows how we all followed him puzzled but incredulous and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes parts were of nickel parts of ivory parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of rock crystal the thing was generally complete but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of drawings and i took one up for a better look at it quartz it seemed to be look here said the medical man are you perfectly serious or is this a trick like that ghost you showed us last christmas upon that machine said the time traveller holding the lamp aloft i intend to explore time is that plain i was never more serious in my life none of us quite knew how to take it i caught filby s eye over the shoulder of the medical man and he winked at me solemnly ii i think that at that time none of us quite believed in the time machine the fact is the time traveller was one of those men who are too clever to be believed you never felt that you saw all round him you always suspected some subtle reserve some ingenuity in ambush behind his lucid frankness had filby shown the model and explained the matter in the time traveller s words we should have shown him far less scepticism for we should have perceived his motives a pork butcher could understand filby but the time traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements and we distrusted him things that would have made the frame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands it is a mistake to do things too easily the serious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment they were somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with egg shell china so i don t think any of us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that thursday and the next though its odd potentialities ran no doubt in most of our minds its plausibility that is its practical incredibleness the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested for my own part i was particularly preoccupied with the trick of the model that i remember discussing with the medical man whom i met on friday at the linnaean he said he had seen a similar thing at tubingen and laid considerable stress on the blowing out of the candle but how the trick was done he could not explain the next thursday i went again to richmond i suppose i was one of the time traveller s most constant guests and arriving late found four or five men already assembled in his drawing room the medical man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his watch in the other i looked round for the time traveller and it s half past seven now said the medical man i suppose we d better have dinner where s said i naming our host you ve just come it s rather odd he s unavoidably detained he asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he s not back says he ll explain when he comes it seems a pity to let the dinner spoil said the editor of a well known daily paper and thereupon the doctor rang the bell the psychologist was the only person besides the doctor and myself who had attended the previous dinner the other men were blank the editor aforementioned a certain journalist and another a quiet shy man with a beard whom i didn t know and who as far as my observation went never opened his mouth all the evening there was some speculation at the dinner table about the time traveller s absence and i suggested time travelling in a half jocular spirit the editor wanted that explained to him and the psychologist volunteered a wooden account of the ingenious paradox and trick we had witnessed that day week he was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise i was facing the door and saw it first hallo i said at last and the door opened wider and the time traveller stood before us i gave a cry of surprise good heavens man what s the matter cried the medical man who saw him next and the whole tableful turned towards the door he was in an amazing plight his coat was dusty and dirty and smeared with green down the sleeves his hair disordered and as it seemed to me greyer either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually faded his face was ghastly pale his chin had a brown cut on it a cut half healed his expression was haggard and drawn as by intense suffering for a moment he hesitated in the doorway as if he had been dazzled by the light then he came into the room he walked with just such a limp as i have seen in footsore tramps we stared at him in silence expecting him to speak he said not a word but came painfully to the table and made a motion towards the wine the editor filled a glass of champagne and pushed it towards him he drained it and it seemed to do him good for he looked round the table and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his face what on earth have you been up to man said the doctor the time traveller did not seem to hear don t let me disturb you he said with a certain faltering articulation i m all right he stopped held out his glass for more and took it off at a draught that s good he said his eyes grew brighter and a faint colour came into his cheeks his glance flickered over our faces with a certain dull approval and then went round the warm and comfortable room then he spoke again still as it were feeling his way among his words i m going to wash and dress and then i ll come down and explain things save me some of that mutton i m starving for a bit of meat he looked across at the editor who was a rare visitor and hoped he was all right the editor began a question tell you presently said the time traveller i m funny be all right in a minute he put down his glass and walked towards the staircase door again i remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall and standing up in my place i saw his feet as he went out he had nothing on them but a pair of tattered blood stained socks then the door closed upon him i had half a mind to follow till i remembered how he detested any fuss about himself for a minute perhaps my mind was wool gathering then remarkable behaviour of an eminent scientist i heard the editor say thinking after his wont in headlines and this brought my attention back to the bright dinner table what s the game said the journalist has he been doing the amateur cadger i don t follow i met the eye of the psychologist and read my own interpretation in his face i thought of the time traveller limping painfully upstairs i don t think any one else had noticed his lameness the first to recover completely from this surprise was the medical man who rang the bell the time traveller hated to have servants waiting at dinner for a hot plate at that the editor turned to his knife and fork with a grunt and the silent man followed suit the dinner was resumed conversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of wonderment and then the editor got fervent in his curiosity does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing or has he his nebuchadnezzar phases he inquired i feel assured it s this business of the time machine i said and took up the psychologist s account of our previous meeting the new guests were frankly incredulous the editor raised objections what was this time travelling a man couldn t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox could he and then as the idea came home to him he resorted to caricature hadn t they any clothes brushes in the future the journalist too would not believe at any price and joined the editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole thing they were both the new kind of journalist very joyous irreverent young men our special correspondent in the day after to morrow reports the journalist was saying or rather shouting when the time traveller came back he was dressed in ordinary evening clothes and nothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had startled me i say said the editor hilariously these chaps here say you have been travelling into the middle of next week tell us all about little rosebery will you what will you take for the lot the time traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word he smiled quietly in his old way where s my mutton he said what a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again story cried the editor story be damned said the time traveller i want something to eat i won t say a word until i get some peptone into my arteries thanks and the salt one word said i have you been time travelling yes said the time traveller with his mouth full nodding his head i d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note said the editor the time traveller pushed his glass towards the silent man and rang it with his fingernail at which the silent man who had been staring at his face started convulsively and poured him wine the rest of the dinner was uncomfortable for my own part sudden questions kept on rising to my lips and i dare say it was the same with the others the journalist tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of hettie potter the time traveller devoted his attention to his dinner and displayed the appetite of a tramp the medical man smoked a cigarette and watched the time traveller through his eyelashes the silent man seemed even more clumsy than usual and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of sheer nervousness at last the time traveller pushed his plate away and looked round us i suppose i must apologize he said i was simply starving i ve had a most amazing time he reached out his hand for a cigar and cut the end but come into the smoking room it s too long a story to tell over greasy plates and ringing the bell in passing he led the way into the adjoining room you have told blank and dash and chose about the machine he said to me leaning back in his easy chair and naming the three new guests but the thing s a mere paradox said the editor i can t argue to night i don t mind telling you the story but i can t argue i will he went on tell you the story of what has happened to me if you like but you must refrain from interruptions i want to tell it badly most of it will sound like lying so be it it s true every word of it all the same i was in my laboratory at four o clock and since then i ve lived eight days such days as no human being ever lived before i m nearly worn out but i shan t sleep till i ve told this thing over to you then i shall go to bed but no interruptions is it agreed agreed said the editor and the rest of us echoed agreed and with that the time traveller began his story as i have set it forth he sat back in his chair at first and spoke like a weary man afterwards he got more animated in writing it down i feel with only too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink and above all my own inadequacy to express its quality you read i will suppose attentively enough but you cannot see the speaker s white sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp nor hear the intonation of his voice you cannot know how his expression followed the turns of his story most of us hearers were in shadow for the candles in the smoking room had not been lighted and only the face of the journalist and the legs of the silent man from the knees downward were illuminated at first we glanced now and again at each other after a time we ceased to do that and looked only at the time traveller s face iii i told some of you last thursday of the principles of the time machine and showed you the actual thing itself incomplete in the workshop there it is now a little travel worn truly and one of the ivory bars is cracked and a brass rail bent but the rest of it s sound enough i expected to finish it on friday but on friday when the putting together was nearly done i found that one of the nickel bars was exactly one inch too short and this i had to get remade so that the thing was not complete until this morning it was at ten o clock to day that the first of all time machines began its career i gave it a last tap tried all the screws again put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod and sat myself in the saddle i suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as i felt then i took the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other pressed the first and almost immediately the second i seemed to reel i felt a nightmare sensation of falling and looking round i saw the laboratory exactly as before had anything happened for a moment i suspected that my intellect had tricked me then i noted the clock a moment before as it seemed it had stood at a minute or so past ten now it was nearly half past three i drew a breath set my teeth gripped the starting lever with both hands and went off with a thud the laboratory got hazy and went dark mrs watchett came in and walked apparently without seeing me towards the garden door i suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket i pressed the lever over to its extreme position the night came like the turning out of a lamp and in another moment came to morrow the laboratory grew faint and hazy then fainter and ever fainter to morrow night came black then day again night again day again faster and faster still an eddying murmur filled my ears and a strange dumb confusedness descended on my mind i am afraid i cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling they are excessively unpleasant there is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback of a helpless headlong motion i felt the same horrible anticipation too of an imminent smash as i put on pace night followed day like the flapping of a black wing the dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me and i saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky leaping it every minute and every minute marking a day i supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and i had come into the open air i had a dim impression of scaffolding but i was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things the slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me the twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye then in the intermittent darknesses i saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars presently as i went on still gaining velocity the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue a splendid luminous color like that of early twilight the jerking sun became a streak of fire a brilliant arch in space the moon a fainter fluctuating band and i could see nothing of the stars save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue the landscape was misty and vague i was still on the hill side upon which this house now stands and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim i saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour now brown now green they grew spread shivered and passed away i saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair and pass like dreams the whole surface of the earth seemed changed melting and flowing under my eyes the little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and faster presently i noted that the sun belt swayed up and down from solstice to solstice in a minute or less and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute and minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world and vanished and was followed by the bright brief green of spring the unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now they merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration i remarked indeed a clumsy swaying of the machine for which i was unable to account but my mind was too confused to attend to it so with a kind of madness growing upon me i flung myself into futurity at first i scarce thought of stopping scarce thought of anything but these new sensations but presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread until at last they took complete possession of me what strange developments of humanity what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilization i thought might not appear when i came to look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes i saw great and splendid architecture rising about me more massive than any buildings of our own time and yet as it seemed built of glimmer and mist i saw a richer green flow up the hill side and remain there without any wintry intermission even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair and so my mind came round to the business of stopping the peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in the space which i or the machine occupied so long as i travelled at a high velocity through time this scarcely mattered i was so to speak attenuated was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of intervening substances but to come to a stop involved the jamming of myself molecule by molecule into whatever lay in my way meant bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical reaction possibly a far reaching explosion would result and blow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions into the unknown this possibility had occurred to me again and again while i was making the machine but then i had cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk one of the risks a man has got to take now the risk was inevitable i no longer saw it in the same cheerful light the fact is that insensibly the absolute strangeness of everything the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine above all the feeling of prolonged falling had absolutely upset my nerve i told myself that i could never stop and with a gust of petulance i resolved to stop forthwith like an impatient fool i lugged over the lever and incontinently the thing went reeling over and i was flung headlong through the air there was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears i may have been stunned for a moment a pitiless hail was hissing round me and i was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine everything still seemed grey but presently i remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone i looked round me i was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a garden surrounded by rhododendron bushes and i noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the hail stones the rebounding dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine and drove along the ground like smoke in a moment i was wet to the skin fine hospitality said i to a man who has travelled innumerable years to see you presently i thought what a fool i was to get wet i stood up and looked round me a colossal figure carved apparently in some white stone loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy downpour but all else of the world was invisible my sensations would be hard to describe as the columns of hail grew thinner i saw the white figure more distinctly it was very large for a silver birch tree touched its shoulder it was of white marble in shape something like a winged sphinx but the wings instead of being carried vertically at the sides were spread so that it seemed to hover the pedestal it appeared to me was of bronze and was thick with verdigris it chanced that the face was towards me the sightless eyes seemed to watch me there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips it was greatly weather worn and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease i stood looking at it for a little space half a minute perhaps or half an hour it seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it denser or thinner at last i tore my eyes from it for a moment and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare and that the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun i looked up again at the crouching white shape and the full temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me what might appear when that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn what might not have happened to men what if cruelty had grown into a common passion what if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had developed into something inhuman unsympathetic and overwhelmingly powerful i might seem some old world savage animal only the more dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness a foul creature to be incontinently slain already i saw other vast shapes huge buildings with intricate parapets and tall columns with a wooded hill side dimly creeping in upon me through the lessening storm i was seized with a panic fear i turned frantically to the time machine and strove hard to readjust it as i did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm the grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a ghost above me in the intense blue of the summer sky some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness the great buildings about me stood out clear and distinct shining with the wet of the thunderstorm and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses i felt naked in a strange world i felt as perhaps a bird may feel in the clear air knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop my fear grew to frenzy i took a breathing space set my teeth and again grappled fiercely wrist and knee with the machine it gave under my desperate onset and turned over it struck my chin violently one hand on the saddle the other on the lever i stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again but with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered i looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote future in a circular opening high up in the wall of the nearer house i saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes they had seen me and their faces were directed towards me then i heard voices approaching me coming through the bushes by the white sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running one of these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which i stood with my machine he was a slight creature perhaps four feet high clad in a purple tunic girdled at the waist with a leather belt sandals or buskins i could not clearly distinguish which were on his feet his legs were bare to the knees and his head was bare noticing that i noticed for the first time how warm the air was he struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature but indescribably frail his flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much at the sight of him i suddenly regained confidence i took my hands from the machine iv in another moment we were standing face to face i and this fragile thing out of futurity he came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes the absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue there were others coming and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me one of them addressed me it came into my head oddly enough that my voice was too harsh and deep for them so i shook my head and pointing to my ears shook it again he came a step forward hesitated and then touched my hand then i felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders they wanted to make sure i was real there was nothing in this at all alarming indeed there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence a graceful gentleness a certain childlike ease and besides they looked so frail that i could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like nine pins but i made a sudden motion to warn them when i saw their little pink hands feeling at the time machine happily then when it was not too late i thought of a danger i had hitherto forgotten and reaching over the bars of the machine i unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion and put these in my pocket then i turned again to see what i could do in the way of communication and then looking more nearly into their features i saw some further peculiarities in their dresden china type of prettiness their hair which was uniformly curly came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face and their ears were singularly minute the mouths were small with bright red rather thin lips and the little chins ran to a point the eyes were large and mild and this may seem egotism on my part i fancied even that there was a certain lack of the interest i might have expected in them as they made no effort to communicate with me but simply stood round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other i began the conversation i pointed to the time machine and to myself then hesitating for a moment how to express time i pointed to the sun at once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed my gesture and then astonished me by imitating the sound of thunder for a moment i was staggered though the import of his gesture was plain enough the question had come into my mind abruptly were these creatures fools you may hardly understand how it took me you see i had always anticipated that the people of the year eight hundred and two thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge art everything then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of our five year old children asked me in fact if i had come from the sun in a thunderstorm it let loose the judgment i had suspended upon their clothes their frail light limbs and fragile features a flow of disappointment rushed across my mind for a moment i felt that i had built the time machine in vain i nodded pointed to the sun and gave them such a vivid rendering of a thunderclap as startled them they all withdrew a pace or so and bowed then came one laughing towards me carrying a chain of beautiful flowers altogether new to me and put it about my neck the idea was received with melodious applause and presently they were all running to and fro for flowers and laughingly flinging them upon me until i was almost smothered with blossom you who have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created then someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the nearest building and so i was led past the sphinx of white marble which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my astonishment towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone as i went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came with irresistible merriment to my mind the building had a huge entry and was altogether of colossal dimensions i was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of little people and with the big open portals that yawned before me shadowy and mysterious my general impression of the world i saw over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers a long neglected and yet weedless garden i saw a number of tall spikes of strange white flowers measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals they grew scattered as if wild among the variegated shrubs but as i say i did not examine them closely at this time the time machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons the arch of the doorway was richly carved but naturally i did not observe the carving very narrowly though i fancied i saw suggestions of old phoenician decorations as i passed through and it struck me that they were very badly broken and weather worn several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway and so we entered i dressed in dingy nineteenth century garments looking grotesque enough garlanded with flowers and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright soft colored robes and shining white limbs in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech the big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with brown the roof was in shadow and the windows partially glazed with coloured glass and partially unglazed admitted a tempered light the floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal not plates nor slabs blocks and it was so much worn as i judged by the going to and fro of past generations as to be deeply channelled along the more frequented ways transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone raised perhaps a foot from the floor and upon these were heaps of fruits some i recognized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange but for the most part they were strange between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions upon these my conductors seated themselves signing for me to do likewise with a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with their hands flinging peel and stalks and so forth into the round openings in the sides of the tables i was not loath to follow their example for i felt thirsty and hungry as i did so i surveyed the hall at my leisure and perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look the stained glass windows which displayed only a geometrical pattern were broken in many places and the curtains that hung across the lower end were thick with dust and it caught my eye that the corner of the marble table near me was fractured nevertheless the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque there were perhaps a couple of hundred people dining in the hall and most of them seated as near to me as they could come were watching me with interest their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating all were clad in the same soft and yet strong silky material fruit by the by was all their diet these people of the remote future were strict vegetarians and while i was with them in spite of some carnal cravings i had to be frugivorous also indeed i found afterwards that horses cattle sheep dogs had followed the ichthyosaurus into extinction but the fruits were very delightful one in particular that seemed to be in season all the time i was there a floury thing in a three sided husk was especially good and i made it my staple at first i was puzzled by all these strange fruits and by the strange flowers i saw but later i began to perceive their import however i am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future now so soon as my appetite was a little checked i determined to make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine clearly that was the next thing to do the fruits seemed a convenient thing to begin upon and holding one of these up i began a series of interrogative sounds and gestures i had some considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning at first my efforts met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter but presently a fair haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name they had to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount of amusement however i felt like a schoolmaster amidst children and persisted and presently i had a score of noun substantives at least at my command and then i got to demonstrative pronouns and even the verb to eat but it was slow work and the little people soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations so i determined rather of necessity to let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined and very little doses i found they were before long for i never met people more indolent or more easily fatigued a queer thing i soon discovered about my little hosts and that was their lack of interest they would come to me with eager cries of astonishment like children but like children they would soon stop examining me and wander away after some other toy the dinner and my conversational beginnings ended i noted for the first time that almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone it is odd too how speedily i came to disregard these little people i went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was satisfied i was continually meeting more of these men of the future who would follow me a little distance chatter and laugh about me and having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way leave me again to my own devices the calm of evening was upon the world as i emerged from the great hall and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun at first things were very confusing everything was so entirely different from the world i had known even the flowers the big building i had left was situated on the slope of a broad river valley but the thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present position i resolved to mount to the summit of a crest perhaps a mile and a half away from which i could get a wider view of this our planet in the year eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one a d for that i should explain was the date the little dials of my machine recorded as i walked i was watching for every impression that could possibly help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which i found the world for ruinous it was a little way up the hill for instance was a great heap of granite bound together by masses of aluminium a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda like plants nettles possibly but wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves and incapable of stinging it was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure to what end built i could not determine it was here that i was destined at a later date to have a very strange experience the first intimation of a still stranger discovery but of that i will speak in its proper place looking round with a sudden thought from a terrace on which i rested for a while i realized that there were no small houses to be seen apparently the single house and possibly even the household had vanished here and there among the greenery were palace like buildings but the house and the cottage which form such characteristic features of our own english landscape had disappeared communism said i to myself and on the heels of that came another thought i looked at the half dozen little figures that were following me then in a flash i perceived that all had the same form of costume the same soft hairless visage and the same girlish rotundity of limb it may seem strange perhaps that i had not noticed this before but everything was so strange now i saw the fact plainly enough in costume and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each other these people of the future were alike and the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents i judged then that the children of that time were extremely precocious physically at least and i found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion seeing the ease and security in which these people were living i felt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would expect for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman the institution of the family and the differentiation of occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical force where population is balanced and abundant much childbearing becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the state where violence comes but rarely and off spring are secure there is less necessity indeed there is no necessity for an efficient family and the specialization of the sexes with reference to their children s needs disappears we see some beginnings of this even in our own time and in this future age it was complete this i must remind you was my speculation at the time later i was to appreciate how far it fell short of the reality while i was musing upon these things my attention was attracted by a pretty little structure like a well under a cupola i thought in a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing and then resumed the thread of my speculations there were no large buildings towards the top of the hill and as my walking powers were evidently miraculous i was presently left alone for the first time with a strange sense of freedom and adventure i pushed on up to the crest there i found a seat of some yellow metal that i did not recognize corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in soft moss the arm rests cast and filed into the resemblance of griffins heads i sat down on it and i surveyed the broad view of our old world under the sunset of that long day it was as sweet and fair a view as i have ever seen the sun had already gone below the horizon and the west was flaming gold touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson below was the valley of the thames in which the river lay like a band of burnished steel i have already spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery some in ruins and some still occupied here and there rose a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth here and there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk there were no hedges no signs of proprietary rights no evidences of agriculture the whole earth had become a garden so watching i began to put my interpretation upon the things i had seen and as it shaped itself to me that evening my interpretation was something in this way afterwards i found i had got only a half truth or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth it seemed to me that i had happened upon humanity upon the wane the ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind for the first time i began to realize an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged and yet come to think it is a logical consequence enough strength is the outcome of need security sets a premium on feebleness the work of ameliorating the conditions of life the true civilizing process that makes life more and more secure had gone steadily on to a climax one triumph of a united humanity over nature had followed another things that are now mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried forward and the harvest was what i saw after all the sanitation and the agriculture of to day are still in the rudimentary stage the science of our time has attacked but a little department of the field of human disease but even so it spreads its operations very steadily and persistently our agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants leaving the greater number to fight out a balance as they can we improve our favourite plants and animals and how few they are gradually by selective breeding now a new and better peach now a seedless grape now a sweeter and larger flower now a more convenient breed of cattle we improve them gradually because our ideals are vague and tentative and our knowledge is very limited because nature too is shy and slow in our clumsy hands some day all this will be better organized and still better that is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies the whole world will be intelligent educated and co operating things will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of nature in the end wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit our human needs this adjustment i say must have been done and done well done indeed for all time in the space of time across which my machine had leaped the air was free from gnats the earth from weeds or fungi everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither the ideal of preventive medicine was attained diseases had been stamped out i saw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay and i shall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been profoundly affected by these changes social triumphs too had been effected i saw mankind housed in splendid shelters gloriously clothed and as yet i had found them engaged in no toil there were no signs of struggle neither social nor economical struggle the shop the advertisement traffic all that commerce which constitutes the body of our world was gone it was natural on that golden evening that i should jump at the idea of a social paradise the difficulty of increasing population had been met i guessed and population had ceased to increase but with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the change what unless biological science is a mass of errors is the cause of human intelligence and vigour hardship and freedom conditions under which the active strong and subtle survive and the weaker go to the wall conditions that put a premium upon the loyal alliance of capable men upon self restraint patience and decision and the institution of the family and the emotions that arise therein the fierce jealousy the tenderness for offspring parental self devotion all found their justification and support in the imminent dangers of the young now where are these imminent dangers there is a sentiment arising and it will grow against connubial jealousy against fierce maternity against passion of all sorts unnecessary things now and things that make us uncomfortable savage survivals discords in a refined and pleasant life i thought of the physical slightness of the people their lack of intelligence and those big abundant ruins and it strengthened my belief in a perfect conquest of nature for after the battle comes quiet humanity had been strong energetic and intelligent and had used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it lived and now came the reaction of the altered conditions under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security that restless energy that with us is strength would become weakness even in our own time certain tendencies and desires once necessary to survival are a constant source of failure physical courage and the love of battle for instance are no great help may even be hindrances to a civilized man and in a state of physical balance and security power intellectual as well as physical would be out of place for countless years i judged there had been no danger of war or solitary violence no danger from wild beasts no wasting disease to require strength of constitution no need of toil for such a life what we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong are indeed no longer weak better equipped indeed they are for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet no doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings i saw was the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived the flourish of that triumph which began the last great peace this has ever been the fate of energy in security it takes to art and to eroticism and then come languor and decay even this artistic impetus would at last die away had almost died in the time i saw to adorn themselves with flowers to dance to sing in the sunlight so much was left of the artistic spirit and no more even that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity we are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity and it seemed to me that here was that hateful grindstone broken at last as i stood there in the gathering dark i thought that in this simple explanation i had mastered the problem of the world mastered the whole secret of these delicious people possibly the checks they had devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well and their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary that would account for the abandoned ruins very simple was my explanation and plausible enough as most wrong theories are v as i stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man the full moon yellow and gibbous came up out of an overflow of silver light in the north east the bright little figures ceased to move about below a noiseless owl flitted by and i shivered with the chill of the night i determined to descend and find where i could sleep i looked for the building i knew then my eye travelled along to the figure of the white sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze growing distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter i could see the silver birch against it there was the tangle of rhododendron bushes black in the pale light and there was the little lawn i looked at the lawn again a queer doubt chilled my complacency no said i stoutly to myself that was not the lawn but it was the lawn for the white leprous face of the sphinx was towards it can you imagine what i felt as this conviction came home to me but you cannot the time machine was gone at once like a lash across the face came the possibility of losing my own age of being left helpless in this strange new world the bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation i could feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing in another moment i was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope once i fell headlong and cut my face i lost no time in stanching the blood but jumped up and ran on with a warm trickle down my cheek and chin all the time i ran i was saying to myself they have moved it a little pushed it under the bushes out of the way nevertheless i ran with all my might all the time with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread i knew that such assurance was folly knew instinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach my breath came with pain i suppose i covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the little lawn two miles perhaps in ten minutes and i am not a young man i cursed aloud as i ran at my confident folly in leaving the machine wasting good breath thereby i cried aloud and none answered not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit world when i reached the lawn my worst fears were realized not a trace of the thing was to be seen i felt faint and cold when i faced the empty space among the black tangle of bushes i ran round it furiously as if the thing might be hidden in a corner and then stopped abruptly with my hands clutching my hair above me towered the sphinx upon the bronze pedestal white shining leprous in the light of the rising moon it seemed to smile in mockery of my dismay i might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put the mechanism in some shelter for me had i not felt assured of their physical and intellectual inadequacy that is what dismayed me the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power through whose intervention my invention had vanished yet for one thing i felt assured unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate the machine could not have moved in time the attachment of the levers i will show you the method later prevented any one from tampering with it in that way when they were removed it had moved and was hid only in space but then where could it be i think i must have had a kind of frenzy i remember running violently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx and startling some white animal that in the dim light i took for a small deer i remember too late that night beating the bushes with my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs then sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind i went down to the great building of stone the big hall was dark silent and deserted i slipped on the uneven floor and fell over one of the malachite tables almost breaking my shin i lit a match and went on past the dusty curtains of which i have told you there i found a second great hall covered with cushions upon which perhaps a score or so of the little people were sleeping i have no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough coming suddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter and flare of a match for they had forgotten about matches where is my time machine i began bawling like an angry child laying hands upon them and shaking them up together it must have been very queer to them some laughed most of them looked sorely frightened when i saw them standing round me it came into my head that i was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the circumstances in trying to revive the sensation of fear for reasoning from their daylight behaviour i thought that fear must be forgotten abruptly i dashed down the match and knocking one of the people over in my course went blundering across the big dining hall again out under the moonlight i heard cries of terror and their little feet running and stumbling this way and that i do not remember all i did as the moon crept up the sky i suppose it was the unexpected nature of my loss that maddened me i felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind a strange animal in an unknown world i must have raved to and fro screaming and crying upon god and fate i have a memory of horrible fatigue as the long night of despair wore away of looking in this impossible place and that of groping among moon lit ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows at last of lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness i had nothing left but misery then i slept and when i woke again it was full day and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm i sat up in the freshness of the morning trying to remember how i had got there and why i had such a profound sense of desertion and despair then things came clear in my mind with the plain reasonable daylight i could look my circumstances fairly in the face i saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight and i could reason with myself suppose the worst i said suppose the machine altogether lost perhaps destroyed it behoves me to be calm and patient to learn the way of the people to get a clear idea of the method of my loss and the means of getting materials and tools so that in the end perhaps i may make another that would be my only hope perhaps but better than despair and after all it was a beautiful and curious world but probably the machine had only been taken away still i must be calm and patient find its hiding place and recover it by force or cunning and with that i scrambled to my feet and looked about me wondering where i could bathe i felt weary stiff and travel soiled the freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness i had exhausted my emotion indeed as i went about my business i found myself wondering at my intense excitement overnight i made a careful examination of the ground about the little lawn i wasted some time in futile questionings conveyed as well as i was able to such of the little people as came by they all failed to understand my gestures some were simply stolid some thought it was a jest and laughed at me i had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces it was a foolish impulse but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity the turf gave better counsel i found a groove ripped in it about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet where on arrival i had struggled with the overturned machine there were other signs of removal about with queer narrow footprints like those i could imagine made by a sloth this directed my closer attention to the pedestal it was as i think i have said of bronze it was not a mere block but highly decorated with deep framed panels on either side i went and rapped at these the pedestal was hollow examining the panels with care i found them discontinuous with the frames there were no handles or keyholes but possibly the panels if they were doors as i supposed opened from within one thing was clear enough to my mind it took no very great mental effort to infer that my time machine was inside that pedestal but how it got there was a different problem i saw the heads of two orange clad people coming through the bushes and under some blossom covered apple trees towards me i turned smiling to them and beckoned them to me they came and then pointing to the bronze pedestal i tried to intimate my wish to open it but at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly i don t know how to convey their expression to you suppose you were to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate minded woman it is how she would look they went off as if they had received the last possible insult i tried a sweet looking little chap in white next with exactly the same result somehow his manner made me feel ashamed of myself but as you know i wanted the time machine and i tried him once more as he turned off like the others my temper got the better of me in three strides i was after him had him by the loose part of his robe round the neck and began dragging him towards the sphinx then i saw the horror and repugnance of his face and all of a sudden i let him go but i was not beaten yet i banged with my fist at the bronze panels i thought i heard something stir inside to be explicit i thought i heard a sound like a chuckle but i must have been mistaken then i got a big pebble from the river and came and hammered till i had flattened a coil in the decorations and the verdigris came off in powdery flakes the delicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand but nothing came of it i saw a crowd of them upon the slopes looking furtively at me at last hot and tired i sat down to watch the place but i was too restless to watch long i am too occidental for a long vigil i could work at a problem for years but to wait inactive for twenty four hours that is another matter i got up after a time and began walking aimlessly through the bushes towards the hill again patience said i to myself if you want your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone if they mean to take your machine away it s little good your wrecking their bronze panels and if they don t you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it to sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is hopeless that way lies monomania face this world learn its ways watch it be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning in the end you will find clues to it all then suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind the thought of the years i had spent in study and toil to get into the future age and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it i had made myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a man devised although it was at my own expense i could not help myself i laughed aloud going through the big palace it seemed to me that the little people avoided me it may have been my fancy or it may have had something to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze yet i felt tolerably sure of the avoidance i was careful however to show no concern and to abstain from any pursuit of them and in the course of a day or two things got back to the old footing i made what progress i could in the language and in addition i pushed my explorations here and there either i missed some subtle point or their language was excessively simple almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs there seemed to be few if any abstract terms or little use of figurative language their sentences were usually simple and of two words and i failed to convey or understand any but the simplest propositions i determined to put the thought of my time machine and the mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural way yet a certain feeling you may understand tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival so far as i could see all the world displayed the same exuberant richness as the thames valley from every hill i climbed i saw the same abundance of splendid buildings endlessly varied in material and style the same clustering thickets of evergreens the same blossom laden trees and tree ferns here and there water shone like silver and beyond the land rose into blue undulating hills and so faded into the serenity of the sky a peculiar feature which presently attracted my attention was the presence of certain circular wells several as it seemed to me of a very great depth one lay by the path up the hill which i had followed during my first walk like the others it was rimmed with bronze curiously wrought and protected by a little cupola from the rain sitting by the side of these wells and peering down into the shafted darkness i could see no gleam of water nor could i start any reflection with a lighted match but in all of them i heard a certain sound a thud thud thud like the beating of some big engine and i discovered from the flaring of my matches that a steady current of air set down the shafts further i threw a scrap of paper into the throat of one and instead of fluttering slowly down it was at once sucked swiftly out of sight after a time too i came to connect these wells with tall towers standing here and there upon the slopes for above them there was often just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a sun scorched beach putting things together i reached a strong suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation whose true import it was difficult to imagine i was at first inclined to associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people it was an obvious conclusion but it was absolutely wrong and here i must admit that i learned very little of drains and bells and modes of conveyance and the like conveniences during my time in this real future in some of these visions of utopias and coming times which i have read there is a vast amount of detail about building and social arrangements and so forth but while such details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is contained in one s imagination they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid such realities as i found here conceive the tale of london which a negro fresh from central africa would take back to his tribe what would he know of railway companies of social movements of telephone and telegraph wires of the parcels delivery company and postal orders and the like yet we at least should be willing enough to explain these things to him and even of what he knew how much could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe then think how narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times and how wide the interval between myself and these of the golden age i was sensible of much which was unseen and which contributed to my comfort but save for a general impression of automatic organization i fear i can convey very little of the difference to your mind in the matter of sepulture for instance i could see no signs of crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs but it occurred to me that possibly there might be cemeteries or crematoria somewhere beyond the range of my explorings this again was a question i deliberately put to myself and my curiosity was at first entirely defeated upon the point the thing puzzled me and i was led to make a further remark which puzzled me still more that aged and infirm among this people there were none i must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an automatic civilization and a decadent humanity did not long endure yet i could think of no other let me put my difficulties the several big palaces i had explored were mere living places great dining halls and sleeping apartments i could find no machinery no appliances of any kind yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at times need renewal and their sandals though undecorated were fairly complex specimens of metalwork somehow such things must be made and the little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency there were no shops no workshops no sign of importations among them they spent all their time in playing gently in bathing in the river in making love in a half playful fashion in eating fruit and sleeping i could not see how things were kept going then again about the time machine something i knew not what had taken it into the hollow pedestal of the white sphinx why for the life of me i could not imagine those waterless wells too those flickering pillars i felt i lacked a clue i felt how shall i put it suppose you found an inscription with sentences here and there in excellent plain english and interpolated therewith others made up of words of letters even absolutely unknown to you well on the third day of my visit that was how the world of eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one presented itself to me that day too i made a friend of a sort it happened that as i was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow one of them was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream the main current ran rather swiftly but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer it will give you an idea therefore of the strange deficiency in these creatures when i tell you that none made the slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes when i realized this i hurriedly slipped off my clothes and wading in at a point lower down i caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land a little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round and i had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before i left her i had got to such a low estimate of her kind that i did not expect any gratitude from her in that however i was wrong this happened in the morning in the afternoon i met my little woman as i believe it was as i was returning towards my centre from an exploration and she received me with cries of delight and presented me with a big garland of flowers evidently made for me and me alone the thing took my imagination very possibly i had been feeling desolate at any rate i did my best to display my appreciation of the gift we were soon seated together in a little stone arbour engaged in conversation chiefly of smiles the creature s friendliness affected me exactly as a child s might have done we passed each other flowers and she kissed my hands i did the same to hers then i tried talk and found that her name was weena which though i don t know what it meant somehow seemed appropriate enough that was the beginning of a queer friendship which lasted a week and ended as i will tell you she was exactly like a child she wanted to be with me always she tried to follow me everywhere and on my next journey out and about it went to my heart to tire her down and leave her at last exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively but the problems of the world had to be mastered i had not i said to myself come into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation yet her distress when i left her was very great her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic and i think altogether i had as much trouble as comfort from her devotion nevertheless she was somehow a very great comfort i thought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me until it was too late i did not clearly know what i had inflicted upon her when i left her nor until it was too late did i clearly understand what she was to me for by merely seeming fond of me and showing in her weak futile way that she cared for me the little doll of a creature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the white sphinx almost the feeling of coming home and i would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold so soon as i came over the hill it was from her too that i learned that fear had not yet left the world she was fearless enough in the daylight and she had the oddest confidence in me for once in a foolish moment i made threatening grimaces at her and she simply laughed at them but she dreaded the dark dreaded shadows dreaded black things darkness to her was the one thing dreadful it was a singularly passionate emotion and it set me thinking and observing i discovered then among other things that these little people gathered into the great houses after dark and slept in droves to enter upon them without a light was to put them into a tumult of apprehension i never found one out of doors or one sleeping alone within doors after dark yet i was still such a blockhead that i missed the lesson of that fear and in spite of weena s distress i insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering multitudes it troubled her greatly but in the end her odd affection for me triumphed and for five of the nights of our acquaintance including the last night of all she slept with her head pillowed on my arm but my story slips away from me as i speak of her it must have been the night before her rescue that i was awakened about dawn i had been restless dreaming most disagreeably that i was drowned and that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps i woke with a start and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed out of the chamber i tried to get to sleep again but i felt restless and uncomfortable it was that dim grey hour when things are just creeping out of darkness when everything is colourless and clear cut and yet unreal i got up and went down into the great hall and so out upon the flagstones in front of the palace i thought i would make a virtue of necessity and see the sunrise the moon was setting and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of dawn were mingled in a ghastly half light the bushes were inky black the ground a sombre grey the sky colourless and cheerless and up the hill i thought i could see ghosts there several times as i scanned the slope i saw white figures twice i fancied i saw a solitary white ape like creature running rather quickly up the hill and once near the ruins i saw a leash of them carrying some dark body they moved hastily i did not see what became of them it seemed that they vanished among the bushes the dawn was still indistinct you must understand i was feeling that chill uncertain early morning feeling you may have known i doubted my eyes as the eastern sky grew brighter and the light of the day came on and its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more i scanned the view keenly but i saw no vestige of my white figures they were mere creatures of the half light they must have been ghosts i said i wonder whence they dated for a queer notion of grant allen s came into my head and amused me if each generation die and leave ghosts he argued the world at last will get overcrowded with them on that theory they would have grown innumerable some eight hundred thousand years hence and it was no great wonder to see four at once but the jest was unsatisfying and i was thinking of these figures all the morning until weena s rescue drove them out of my head i associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal i had startled in my first passionate search for the time machine but weena was a pleasant substitute yet all the same they were soon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind i think i have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of this golden age i cannot account for it it may be that the sun was hotter or the earth nearer the sun it is usual to assume that the sun will go on cooling steadily in the future but people unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger darwin forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body as these catastrophes occur the sun will blaze with renewed energy and it may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate whatever the reason the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know it well one very hot morning my fourth i think as i was seeking shelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where i slept and fed there happened this strange thing clambering among these heaps of masonry i found a narrow gallery whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone by contrast with the brilliancy outside it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me i entered it groping for the change from light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me suddenly i halted spellbound a pair of eyes luminous by reflection against the daylight without was watching me out of the darkness the old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me i clenched my hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs i was afraid to turn then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living came to my mind and then i remembered that strange terror of the dark overcoming my fear to some extent i advanced a step and spoke i will admit that my voice was harsh and ill controlled i put out my hand and touched something soft at once the eyes darted sideways and something white ran past me i turned with my heart in my mouth and saw a queer little ape like figure its head held down in a peculiar manner running across the sunlit space behind me it blundered against a block of granite staggered aside and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry my impression of it is of course imperfect but i know it was a dull white and had strange large greyish red eyes also that there was flaxen hair on its head and down its back but as i say it went too fast for me to see distinctly i cannot even say whether it ran on all fours or only with its forearms held very low after an instant s pause i followed it into the second heap of ruins i could not find it at first but after a time in the profound obscurity i came upon one of those round well like openings of which i have told you half closed by a fallen pillar a sudden thought came to me could this thing have vanished down the shaft i lit a match and looking down i saw a small white moving creature with large bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated it made me shudder it was so like a human spider it was clambering down the wall and now i saw for the first time a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand going out as it dropped and when i had lit another the little monster had disappeared i do not know how long i sat peering down that well it was not for some time that i could succeed in persuading myself that the thing i had seen was human but gradually the truth dawned on me that man had not remained one species but had differentiated into two distinct animals that my graceful children of the upper world were not the sole descendants of our generation but that this bleached obscene nocturnal thing which had flashed before me was also heir to all the ages i thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground ventilation i began to suspect their true import and what i wondered was this lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced organization how was it related to the indolent serenity of the beautiful upper worlders and what was hidden down there at the foot of that shaft i sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that at any rate there was nothing to fear and that there i must descend for the solution of my difficulties and withal i was absolutely afraid to go as i hesitated two of the beautiful upper world people came running in their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow the male pursued the female flinging flowers at her as he ran they seemed distressed to find me my arm against the overturned pillar peering down the well apparently it was considered bad form to remark these apertures for when i pointed to this one and tried to frame a question about it in their tongue they were still more visibly distressed and turned away but they were interested by my matches and i struck some to amuse them i tried them again about the well and again i failed so presently i left them meaning to go back to weena and see what i could get from her but my mind was already in revolution my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a new adjustment i had now a clue to the import of these wells to the ventilating towers to the mystery of the ghosts to say nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the time machine and very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me here was the new view plainly this second species of man was subterranean there were three circumstances in particular which made me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a long continued underground habit in the first place there was the bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark the white fish of the kentucky caves for instance then those large eyes with that capacity for reflecting light are common features of nocturnal things witness the owl and the cat and last of all that evident confusion in the sunshine that hasty yet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow and that peculiar carriage of the head while in the light all reinforced the theory of an extreme sensitiveness of the retina beneath my feet then the earth must be tunnelled enormously and these tunnellings were the habitat of the new race the presence of ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes everywhere in fact except along the river valley showed how universal were its ramifications what so natural then as to assume that it was in this artificial underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of the daylight race was done the notion was so plausible that i at once accepted it and went on to assume the how of this splitting of the human species i dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory though for myself i very soon felt that it fell far short of the truth at first proceeding from the problems of our own age it seemed clear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely temporary and social difference between the capitalist and the labourer was the key to the whole position no doubt it will seem grotesque enough to you and wildly incredible and yet even now there are existing circumstances to point that way there is a tendency to utilize underground space for the less ornamental purposes of civilization there is the metropolitan railway in london for instance there are new electric railways there are subways there are underground workrooms and restaurants and they increase and multiply evidently i thought this tendency had increased till industry had gradually lost its birthright in the sky i mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories spending a still increasing amount of its time therein till in the end even now does not an east end worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the earth again the exclusive tendency of richer people due no doubt to the increasing refinement of their education and the widening gulf between them and the rude violence of the poor is already leading to the closing in their interest of considerable portions of the surface of the land about london for instance perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against intrusion and this same widening gulf which is due to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the part of the rich will make that exchange between class and class that promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines of social stratification less and less frequent so in the end above ground you must have the haves pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty and below ground the have nots the workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of their labour once they were there they would no doubt have to pay rent and not a little of it for the ventilation of their caverns and if they refused they would starve or be suffocated for arrears such of them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die and in the end the balance being permanent the survivors would become as well adapted to the conditions of underground life and as happy in their way as the upper world people were to theirs as it seemed to me the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally enough the great triumph of humanity i had dreamed of took a different shape in my mind it had been no such triumph of moral education and general co operation as i had imagined instead i saw a real aristocracy armed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the industrial system of to day its triumph had not been simply a triumph over nature but a triumph over nature and the fellow man this i must warn you was my theory at the time i had no convenient cicerone in the pattern of the utopian books my explanation may be absolutely wrong i still think it is the most plausible one but even on this supposition the balanced civilization that was at last attained must have long since passed its zenith and was now far fallen into decay the too perfect security of the upper worlders had led them to a slow movement of degeneration to a general dwindling in size strength and intelligence that i could see clearly enough already what had happened to the under grounders i did not yet suspect but from what i had seen of the morlocks that by the by was the name by which these creatures were called i could imagine that the modification of the human type was even far more profound than among the eloi the beautiful race that i already knew then came troublesome doubts why had the morlocks taken my time machine for i felt sure it was they who had taken it why too if the eloi were masters could they not restore the machine to me and why were they so terribly afraid of the dark i proceeded as i have said to question weena about this under world but here again i was disappointed at first she would not understand my questions and presently she refused to answer them she shivered as though the topic was unendurable and when i pressed her perhaps a little harshly she burst into tears they were the only tears except my own i ever saw in that golden age when i saw them i ceased abruptly to trouble about the morlocks and was only concerned in banishing these signs of the human inheritance from weena s eyes and very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands while i solemnly burned a match vi it may seem odd to you but it was two days before i could follow up the new found clue in what was manifestly the proper way i felt a peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies they were just the half bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in spirit in a zoological museum and they were filthily cold to the touch probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the eloi whose disgust of the morlocks i now began to appreciate the next night i did not sleep well probably my health was a little disordered i was oppressed with perplexity and doubt once or twice i had a feeling of intense fear for which i could perceive no definite reason i remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight that night weena was among them and feeling reassured by their presence it occurred to me even then that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its last quarter and the nights grow dark when the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below these whitened lemurs this new vermin that had replaced the old might be more abundant and on both these days i had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty i felt assured that the time machine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these underground mysteries yet i could not face the mystery if only i had had a companion it would have been different but i was so horribly alone and even to clamber down into the darkness of the well appalled me i don t know if you will understand my feeling but i never felt quite safe at my back it was this restlessness this insecurity perhaps that drove me further and further afield in my exploring expeditions going to the south westward towards the rising country that is now called combe wood i observed far off in the direction of nineteenth century banstead a vast green structure different in character from any i had hitherto seen it was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins i knew and the facade had an oriental look the face of it having the lustre as well as the pale green tint a kind of bluish green of a certain type of chinese porcelain this difference in aspect suggested a difference in use and i was minded to push on and explore but the day was growing late and i had come upon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit so i resolved to hold over the adventure for the following day and i returned to the welcome and the caresses of little weena but next morning i perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the palace of green porcelain was a piece of self deception to enable me to shirk by another day an experience i dreaded i resolved i would make the descent without further waste of time and started out in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite and aluminium little weena ran with me she danced beside me to the well but when she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward she seemed strangely disconcerted good bye little weena i said kissing her and then putting her down i began to feel over the parapet for the climbing hooks rather hastily i may as well confess for i feared my courage might leak away at first she watched me in amazement then she gave a most piteous cry and running to me she began to pull at me with her little hands i think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed i shook her off perhaps a little roughly and in another moment i was in the throat of the well i saw her agonized face over the parapet and smiled to reassure her then i had to look down at the unstable hooks to which i clung i had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards the descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides of the well and these being adapted to the needs of a creature much smaller and lighter than myself i was speedily cramped and fatigued by the descent and not simply fatigued one of the bars bent suddenly under my weight and almost swung me off into the blackness beneath for a moment i hung by one hand and after that experience i did not dare to rest again though my arms and back were presently acutely painful i went on clambering down the sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible glancing upward i saw the aperture a small blue disk in which a star was visible while little weena s head showed as a round black projection the thudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive everything save that little disk above was profoundly dark and when i looked up again weena had disappeared i was in an agony of discomfort i had some thought of trying to go up the shaft again and leave the under world alone but even while i turned this over in my mind i continued to descend at last with intense relief i saw dimly coming up a foot to the right of me a slender loophole in the wall swinging myself in i found it was the aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which i could lie down and rest it was not too soon my arms ached my back was cramped and i was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall besides this the unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes the air was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft i do not know how long i lay i was roused by a soft hand touching my face starting up in the darkness i snatched at my matches and hastily striking one i saw three stooping white creatures similar to the one i had seen above ground in the ruin hastily retreating before the light living as they did in what appeared to me impenetrable darkness their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes and they reflected the light in the same way i have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light but so soon as i struck a match in order to see them they fled incontinently vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion i tried to call to them but the language they had was apparently different from that of the over world people so that i was needs left to my own unaided efforts and the thought of flight before exploration was even then in my mind but i said to myself you are in for it now and feeling my way along the tunnel i found the noise of machinery grow louder presently the walls fell away from me and i came to a large open space and striking another match saw that i had entered a vast arched cavern which stretched into utter darkness beyond the range of my light the view i had of it was as much as one could see in the burning of a match necessarily my memory is vague great shapes like big machines rose out of the dimness and cast grotesque black shadows in which dim spectral morlocks sheltered from the glare the place by the by was very stuffy and oppressive and the faint halitus of freshly shed blood was in the air some way down the central vista was a little table of white metal laid with what seemed a meal the morlocks at any rate were carnivorous even at the time i remember wondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red joint i saw it was all very indistinct the heavy smell the big unmeaning shapes the obscene figures lurking in the shadows and only waiting for the darkness to come at me again then the match burned down and stung my fingers and fell a wriggling red spot in the blackness i have thought since how particularly ill equipped i was for such an experience when i had started with the time machine i had started with the absurd assumption that the men of the future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances i had come without arms without medicine without anything to smoke at times i missed tobacco frightfully even without enough matches if only i had thought of a kodak i could have flashed that glimpse of the underworld in a second and examined it at leisure but as it was i stood there with only the weapons and the powers that nature had endowed me with hands feet and teeth these and four safety matches that still remained to me i was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark and it was only with my last glimpse of light i discovered that my store of matches had run low it had never occurred to me until that moment that there was any need to economize them and i had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the upper worlders to whom fire was a novelty now as i say i had four left and while i stood in the dark a hand touched mine lank fingers came feeling over my face and i was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour i fancied i heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me i felt the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing the sense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably unpleasant the sudden realization of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness i shouted at them as loudly as i could they started away and then i could feel them approaching me again they clutched at me more boldly whispering odd sounds to each other i shivered violently and shouted again rather discordantly this time they were not so seriously alarmed and they made a queer laughing noise as they came back at me i will confess i was horribly frightened i determined to strike another match and escape under the protection of its glare i did so and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper from my pocket i made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel but i had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the blackness i could hear the morlocks rustling like wind among leaves and pattering like the rain as they hurried after me in a moment i was clutched by several hands and there was no mistaking that they were trying to haul me back i struck another light and waved it in their dazzled faces you can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked those pale chinless faces and great lidless pinkish grey eyes as they stared in their blindness and bewilderment but i did not stay to look i promise you i retreated again and when my second match had ended i struck my third it had almost burned through when i reached the opening into the shaft i lay down on the edge for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy then i felt sideways for the projecting hooks and as i did so my feet were grasped from behind and i was violently tugged backward i lit my last match and it incontinently went out but i had my hand on the climbing bars now and kicking violently i disengaged myself from the clutches of the morlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft while they stayed peering and blinking up at me all but one little wretch who followed me for some way and well nigh secured my boot as a trophy that climb seemed interminable to me with the last twenty or thirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me i had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold the last few yards was a frightful struggle against this faintness several times my head swam and i felt all the sensations of falling at last however i got over the well mouth somehow and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight i fell upon my face even the soil smelt sweet and clean then i remember weena kissing my hands and ears and the voices of others among the eloi then for a time i was insensible vii now indeed i seemed in a worse case than before hitherto except during my night s anguish at the loss of the time machine i had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape but that hope was staggered by these new discoveries hitherto i had merely thought myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people and by some unknown forces which i had only to understand to overcome but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of the morlocks a something inhuman and malign instinctively i loathed them before i had felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it now i felt like a beast in a trap whose enemy would come upon him soon the enemy i dreaded may surprise you it was the darkness of the new moon weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible remarks about the dark nights it was not now such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming dark nights might mean the moon was on the wane each night there was a longer interval of darkness and i now understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear of the little upper world people for the dark i wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that the morlocks did under the new moon i felt pretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong the upper world people might once have been the favoured aristocracy and the morlocks their mechanical servants but that had long since passed away the two species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down towards or had already arrived at an altogether new relationship the eloi like the carolingian kings had decayed to a mere beautiful futility they still possessed the earth on sufferance since the morlocks subterranean for innumerable generations had come at last to find the daylit surface intolerable and the morlocks made their garments i inferred and maintained them in their habitual needs perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service they did it as a standing horse paws with his foot or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the organism but clearly the old order was already in part reversed the nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace ages ago thousands of generations ago man had thrust his brother man out of the ease and the sunshine and now that brother was coming back changed already the eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew they were becoming reacquainted with fear and suddenly there came into my head the memory of the meat i had seen in the under world it seemed odd how it floated into my mind not stirred up as it were by the current of my meditations but coming in almost like a question from outside i tried to recall the form of it i had a vague sense of something familiar but i could not tell what it was at the time still however helpless the little people in the presence of their mysterious fear i was differently constituted i came out of this age of ours this ripe prime of the human race when fear does not paralyse and mystery has lost its terrors i at least would defend myself without further delay i determined to make myself arms and a fastness where i might sleep with that refuge as a base i could face this strange world with some of that confidence i had lost in realizing to what creatures night by night i lay exposed i felt i could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them i shuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined me i wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the thames but found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible all the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers as the morlocks to judge by their wells must be then the tall pinnacles of the palace of green porcelain and the polished gleam of its walls came back to my memory and in the evening taking weena like a child upon my shoulder i went up the hills towards the south west the distance i had reckoned was seven or eight miles but it must have been nearer eighteen i had first seen the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished in addition the heel of one of my shoes was loose and a nail was working through the sole they were comfortable old shoes i wore about indoors so that i was lame and it was already long past sunset when i came in sight of the palace silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky weena had been hugely delighted when i began to carry her but after a while she desired me to let her down and ran along by the side of me occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my pockets my pockets had always puzzled weena but at the last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vase for floral decoration at least she utilized them for that purpose and that reminds me in changing my jacket i found the time traveller paused put his hand into his pocket and silently placed two withered flowers not unlike very large white mallows upon the little table then he resumed his narrative as the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the hill crest towards wimbledon weena grew tired and wanted to return to the house of grey stone but i pointed out the distant pinnacles of the palace of green porcelain to her and contrived to make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her fear you know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk even the breeze stops in the trees to me there is always an air of expectation about that evening stillness the sky was clear remote and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the sunset well that night the expectation took the colour of my fears in that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally sharpened i fancied i could even feel the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet could indeed almost see through it the morlocks on their ant hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark in my excitement i fancied that they would receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war and why had they taken my time machine so we went on in the quiet and the twilight deepened into night the clear blue of the distance faded and one star after another came out the ground grew dim and the trees black weena s fears and her fatigue grew upon her i took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed her then as the darkness grew deeper she put her arms round my neck and closing her eyes tightly pressed her face against my shoulder so we went down a long slope into a valley and there in the dimness i almost walked into a little river this i waded and went up the opposite side of the valley past a number of sleeping houses and by a statue a faun or some such figure minus the head here too were acacias so far i had seen nothing of the morlocks but it was yet early in the night and the darker hours before the old moon rose were still to come from the brow of the next hill i saw a thick wood spreading wide and black before me i hesitated at this i could see no end to it either to the right or the left feeling tired my feet in particular were very sore i carefully lowered weena from my shoulder as i halted and sat down upon the turf i could no longer see the palace of green porcelain and i was in doubt of my direction i looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide under that dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars even were there no other lurking danger a danger i did not care to let my imagination loose upon there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the tree boles to strike against i was very tired too after the excitements of the day so i decided that i would not face it but would pass the night upon the open hill weena i was glad to find was fast asleep i carefully wrapped her in my jacket and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise the hill side was quiet and deserted but from the black of the wood there came now and then a stir of living things above me shone the stars for the night was very clear i felt a certain sense of friendly comfort in their twinkling all the old constellations had gone from the sky however that slow movement which is imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings but the milky way it seemed to me was still the same tattered streamer of star dust as of yore southward as i judged it was a very bright red star that was new to me it was even more splendid than our own green sirius and amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the gravities of terrestrial life i thought of their unfathomable distance and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the unknown past into the unknown future i thought of the great precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes only forty times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that i had traversed and during these few revolutions all the activity all the traditions the complex organizations the nations languages literatures aspirations even the mere memory of man as i knew him had been swept out of existence instead were these frail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry and the white things of which i went in terror then i thought of the great fear that was between the two species and for the first time with a sudden shiver came the clear knowledge of what the meat i had seen might be yet it was too horrible i looked at little weena sleeping beside me her face white and starlike under the stars and forthwith dismissed the thought through that long night i held my mind off the morlocks as well as i could and whiled away the time by trying to fancy i could find signs of the old constellations in the new confusion the sky kept very clear except for a hazy cloud or so no doubt i dozed at times then as my vigil wore on came a faintness in the eastward sky like the reflection of some colourless fire and the old moon rose thin and peaked and white and close behind and overtaking it and overflowing it the dawn came pale at first and then growing pink and warm no morlocks had approached us indeed i had seen none upon the hill that night and in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable i stood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel so i sat down again took off my shoes and flung them away i awakened weena and we went down into the wood now green and pleasant instead of black and forbidding we found some fruit wherewith to break our fast we soon met others of the dainty ones laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as the night and then i thought once more of the meat that i had seen i felt assured now of what it was and from the bottom of my heart i pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity clearly at some time in the long ago of human decay the morlocks food had run short possibly they had lived on rats and such like vermin even now man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he was far less than any monkey his prejudice against human flesh is no deep seated instinct and so these inhuman sons of men i tried to look at the thing in a scientific spirit after all they were less human and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago and the intelligence that would have made this state of things a torment had gone why should i trouble myself these eloi were mere fatted cattle which the ant like morlocks preserved and preyed upon probably saw to the breeding of and there was weena dancing at my side then i tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon me by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness man had been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his fellow man had taken necessity as his watchword and excuse and in the fullness of time necessity had come home to him i even tried a carlyle like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay but this attitude of mind was impossible however great their intellectual degradation the eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim my sympathy and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and their fear i had at that time very vague ideas as to the course i should pursue my first was to secure some safe place of refuge and to make myself such arms of metal or stone as i could contrive that necessity was immediate in the next place i hoped to procure some means of fire so that i should have the weapon of a torch at hand for nothing i knew would be more efficient against these morlocks then i wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the white sphinx i had in mind a battering ram i had a persuasion that if i could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me i should discover the time machine and escape i could not imagine the morlocks were strong enough to move it far away weena i had resolved to bring with me to our own time and turning such schemes over in my mind i pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling viii i found the palace of green porcelain when we approached it about noon deserted and falling into ruin only ragged vestiges of glass remained in its windows and great sheets of the green facing had fallen away from the corroded metallic framework it lay very high upon a turfy down and looking north eastward before i entered it i was surprised to see a large estuary or even creek where i judged wandsworth and battersea must once have been i thought then though i never followed up the thought of what might have happened or might be happening to the living things in the sea the material of the palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain and along the face of it i saw an inscription in some unknown character i thought rather foolishly that weena might help me to interpret this but i only learned that the bare idea of writing had never entered her head she always seemed to me i fancy more human than she was perhaps because her affection was so human within the big valves of the door which were open and broken we found instead of the customary hall a long gallery lit by many side windows at the first glance i was reminded of a museum the tiled floor was thick with dust and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering then i perceived standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall what was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton i recognized by the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the fashion of the megatherium the skull and the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust and in one place where rain water had dropped through a leak in the roof the thing itself had been worn away further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a brontosaurus my museum hypothesis was confirmed going towards the side i found what appeared to be sloping shelves and clearing away the thick dust i found the old familiar glass cases of our own time but they must have been air tight to judge from the fair preservation of some of their contents clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter day south kensington here apparently was the palaeontological section and a very splendid array of fossils it must have been though the inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time and had through the extinction of bacteria and fungi lost ninety nine hundredths of its force was nevertheless with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures here and there i found traces of the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds and the cases had in some instances been bodily removed by the morlocks as i judged the place was very silent the thick dust deadened our footsteps weena who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case presently came as i stared about me and very quietly took my hand and stood beside me and at first i was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an intellectual age that i gave no thought to the possibilities it presented even my preoccupation about the time machine receded a little from my mind to judge from the size of the place this palace of green porcelain had a great deal more in it than a gallery of palaeontology possibly historical galleries it might be even a library to me at least in my present circumstances these would be vastly more interesting than this spectacle of oldtime geology in decay exploring i found another short gallery running transversely to the first this appeared to be devoted to minerals and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder but i could find no saltpeter indeed no nitrates of any kind doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago yet the sulphur hung in my mind and set up a train of thinking as for the rest of the contents of that gallery though on the whole they were the best preserved of all i saw i had little interest i am no specialist in mineralogy and i went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall i had entered apparently this section had been devoted to natural history but everything had long since passed out of recognition a few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed animals desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit a brown dust of departed plants that was all i was sorry for that because i should have been glad to trace the patent readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been attained then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions but singularly ill lit the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the end at which i entered at intervals white globes hung from the ceiling many of them cracked and smashed which suggested that originally the place had been artificially lit here i was more in my element for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big machines all greatly corroded and many broken down but some still fairly complete you know i have a certain weakness for mechanism and i was inclined to linger among these the more so as for the most part they had the interest of puzzles and i could make only the vaguest guesses at what they were for i fancied that if i could solve their puzzles i should find myself in possession of powers that might be of use against the morlocks suddenly weena came very close to my side so suddenly that she startled me had it not been for her i do not think i should have noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all footnote it may be of course that the floor did not slope but that the museum was built into the side of a hill ed the end i had come in at was quite above ground and was lit by rare slit like windows as you went down the length the ground came up against these windows until at last there was a pit like the area of a london house before each and only a narrow line of daylight at the top i went slowly along puzzling about the machines and had been too intent upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light until weena s increasing apprehensions drew my attention then i saw that the gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness i hesitated and then as i looked round me i saw that the dust was less abundant and its surface less even further away towards the dimness it appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints my sense of the immediate presence of the morlocks revived at that i felt that i was wasting my time in the academic examination of machinery i called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon and that i had still no weapon no refuge and no means of making a fire and then down in the remote blackness of the gallery i heard a peculiar pattering and the same odd noises i had heard down the well i took weena s hand then struck with a sudden idea i left her and turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a signal box clambering upon the stand and grasping this lever in my hands i put all my weight upon it sideways suddenly weena deserted in the central aisle began to whimper i had judged the strength of the lever pretty correctly for it snapped after a minute s strain and i rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient i judged for any morlock skull i might encounter and i longed very much to kill a morlock or so very inhuman you may think to want to go killing one s own descendants but it was impossible somehow to feel any humanity in the things only my disinclination to leave weena and a persuasion that if i began to slake my thirst for murder my time machine might suffer restrained me from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes i heard well mace in one hand and weena in the other i went out of that gallery and into another and still larger one which at the first glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags the brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it i presently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books they had long since dropped to pieces and every semblance of print had left them but here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the tale well enough had i been a literary man i might perhaps have moralized upon the futility of all ambition but as it was the thing that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified at the time i will confess that i thought chiefly of the philosophical transactions and my own seventeen papers upon physical optics then going up a broad staircase we came to what may once have been a gallery of technical chemistry and here i had not a little hope of useful discoveries except at one end where the roof had collapsed this gallery was well preserved i went eagerly to every unbroken case and at last in one of the really air tight cases i found a box of matches very eagerly i tried them they were perfectly good they were not even damp i turned to weena dance i cried to her in her own tongue for now i had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared and so in that derelict museum upon the thick soft carpeting of dust to weena s huge delight i solemnly performed a kind of composite dance whistling the land of the leal as cheerfully as i could in part it was a modest cancan in part a step dance in part a skirt dance so far as my tail coat permitted and in part original for i am naturally inventive as you know now i still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange as for me it was a most fortunate thing yet oddly enough i found a far unlikelier substance and that was camphor i found it in a sealed jar that by chance i suppose had been really hermetically sealed i fancied at first that it was paraffin wax and smashed the glass accordingly but the odour of camphor was unmistakable in the universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive perhaps through many thousands of centuries it reminded me of a sepia painting i had once seen done from the ink of a fossil belemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millions of years ago i was about to throw it away but i remembered that it was inflammable and burned with a good bright flame was in fact an excellent candle and i put it in my pocket i found no explosives however nor any means of breaking down the bronze doors as yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing i had chanced upon nevertheless i left that gallery greatly elated i cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon it would require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all the proper order i remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms and how i hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword i could not carry both however and my bar of iron promised best against the bronze gates there were numbers of guns pistols and rifles the most were masses of rust but many were of some new metal and still fairly sound but any cartridges or powder there may once have been had rotted into dust one corner i saw was charred and shattered perhaps i thought by an explosion among the specimens in another place was a vast array of idols polynesian mexican grecian phoenician every country on earth i should think and here yielding to an irresistible impulse i wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from south america that particularly took my fancy as the evening drew on my interest waned i went through gallery after gallery dusty silent often ruinous the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of rust and lignite sometimes fresher in one place i suddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine and then by the merest accident i discovered in an air tight case two dynamite cartridges i shouted eureka and smashed the case with joy then came a doubt i hesitated then selecting a little side gallery i made my essay i never felt such a disappointment as i did in waiting five ten fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came of course the things were dummies as i might have guessed from their presence i really believe that had they not been so i should have rushed off incontinently and blown sphinx bronze doors and as it proved my chances of finding the time machine all together into non existence it was after that i think that we came to a little open court within the palace it was turfed and had three fruit trees so we rested and refreshed ourselves towards sunset i began to consider our position night was creeping upon us and my inaccessible hiding place had still to be found but that troubled me very little now i had in my possession a thing that was perhaps the best of all defences against the morlocks i had matches i had the camphor in my pocket too if a blaze were needed it seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open protected by a fire in the morning there was the getting of the time machine towards that as yet i had only my iron mace but now with my growing knowledge i felt very differently towards those bronze doors up to this i had refrained from forcing them largely because of the mystery on the other side they had never impressed me as being very strong and i hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the work ix we emerged from the palace while the sun was still in part above the horizon i was determined to reach the white sphinx early the next morning and ere the dusk i purposed pushing through the woods that had stopped me on the previous journey my plan was to go as far as possible that night and then building a fire to sleep in the protection of its glare accordingly as we went along i gathered any sticks or dried grass i saw and presently had my arms full of such litter thus loaded our progress was slower than i had anticipated and besides weena was tired and i began to suffer from sleepiness too so that it was full night before we reached the wood upon the shrubby hill of its edge weena would have stopped fearing the darkness before us but a singular sense of impending calamity that should indeed have served me as a warning drove me onward i had been without sleep for a night and two days and i was feverish and irritable i felt sleep coming upon me and the morlocks with it while we hesitated among the black bushes behind us and dim against their blackness i saw three crouching figures there was scrub and long grass all about us and i did not feel safe from their insidious approach the forest i calculated was rather less than a mile across if we could get through it to the bare hill side there as it seemed to me was an altogether safer resting place i thought that with my matches and my camphor i could contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods yet it was evident that if i was to flourish matches with my hands i should have to abandon my firewood so rather reluctantly i put it down and then it came into my head that i would amaze our friends behind by lighting it i was to discover the atrocious folly of this proceeding but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering our retreat i don t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be in the absence of man and in a temperate climate the sun s heat is rarely strong enough to burn even when it is focused by dewdrops as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts lightning may blast and blacken but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation but this rarely results in flame in this decadence too the art of fire making had been forgotten on the earth the red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to weena she wanted to run to it and play with it i believe she would have cast herself into it had i not restrained her but i caught her up and in spite of her struggles plunged boldly before me into the wood for a little way the glare of my fire lit the path looking back presently i could see through the crowded stems that from my heap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent and a curved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill i laughed at that and turned again to the dark trees before me it was very black and weena clung to me convulsively but there was still as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness sufficient light for me to avoid the stems overhead it was simply black except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there i struck none of my matches because i had no hand free upon my left arm i carried my little one in my right hand i had my iron bar for some way i heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet the faint rustle of the breeze above and my own breathing and the throb of the blood vessels in my ears then i seemed to know of a pattering about me i pushed on grimly the pattering grew more distinct and then i caught the same queer sound and voices i had heard in the under world there were evidently several of the morlocks and they were closing in upon me indeed in another minute i felt a tug at my coat then something at my arm and weena shivered violently and became quite still it was time for a match but to get one i must put her down i did so and as i fumbled with my pocket a struggle began in the darkness about my knees perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar cooing sounds from the morlocks soft little hands too were creeping over my coat and back touching even my neck then the match scratched and fizzed i held it flaring and saw the white backs of the morlocks in flight amid the trees i hastily took a lump of camphor from my pocket and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane then i looked at weena she was lying clutching my feet and quite motionless with her face to the ground with a sudden fright i stooped to her she seemed scarcely to breathe i lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground and as it split and flared up and drove back the morlocks and the shadows i knelt down and lifted her the wood behind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great company she seemed to have fainted i put her carefully upon my shoulder and rose to push on and then there came a horrible realization in manoeuvring with my matches and weena i had turned myself about several times and now i had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my path for all i knew i might be facing back towards the palace of green porcelain i found myself in a cold sweat i had to think rapidly what to do i determined to build a fire and encamp where we were i put weena still motionless down upon a turfy bole and very hastily as my first lump of camphor waned i began collecting sticks and leaves here and there out of the darkness round me the morlocks eyes shone like carbuncles the camphor flickered and went out i lit a match and as i did so two white forms that had been approaching weena dashed hastily away one was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me and i felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist he gave a whoop of dismay staggered a little way and fell down i lit another piece of camphor and went on gathering my bonfire presently i noticed how dry was some of the foliage above me for since my arrival on the time machine a matter of a week no rain had fallen so instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs i began leaping up and dragging down branches very soon i had a choking smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks and could economize my camphor then i turned to where weena lay beside my iron mace i tried what i could to revive her but she lay like one dead i could not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed now the smoke of the fire beat over towards me and it must have made me heavy of a sudden moreover the vapour of camphor was in the air my fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so i felt very weary after my exertion and sat down the wood too was full of a slumbrous murmur that i did not understand i seemed just to nod and open my eyes but all was dark and the morlocks had their hands upon me flinging off their clinging fingers i hastily felt in my pocket for the match box and it had gone then they gripped and closed with me again in a moment i knew what had happened i had slept and my fire had gone out and the bitterness of death came over my soul the forest seemed full of the smell of burning wood i was caught by the neck by the hair by the arms and pulled down it was indescribably horrible in the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me i felt as if i was in a monstrous spider s web i was overpowered and went down i felt little teeth nipping at my neck i rolled over and as i did so my hand came against my iron lever it gave me strength i struggled up shaking the human rats from me and holding the bar short i thrust where i judged their faces might be i could feel the succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows and for a moment i was free the strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting came upon me i knew that both i and weena were lost but i determined to make the morlocks pay for their meat i stood with my back to a tree swinging the iron bar before me the whole wood was full of the stir and cries of them a minute passed their voices seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement and their movements grew faster yet none came within reach i stood glaring at the blackness then suddenly came hope what if the morlocks were afraid and close on the heels of that came a strange thing the darkness seemed to grow luminous very dimly i began to see the morlocks about me three battered at my feet and then i recognized with incredulous surprise that the others were running in an incessant stream as it seemed from behind me and away through the wood in front and their backs seemed no longer white but reddish as i stood agape i saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight between the branches and vanish and at that i understood the smell of burning wood the slumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar the red glow and the morlocks flight stepping out from behind my tree and looking back i saw through the black pillars of the nearer trees the flames of the burning forest it was my first fire coming after me with that i looked for weena but she was gone the hissing and crackling behind me the explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame left little time for reflection my iron bar still gripped i followed in the morlocks path it was a close race once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as i ran that i was outflanked and had to strike off to the left but at last i emerged upon a small open space and as i did so a morlock came blundering towards me and past me and went on straight into the fire and now i was to see the most weird and horrible thing i think of all that i beheld in that future age this whole space was as bright as day with the reflection of the fire in the centre was a hillock or tumulus surmounted by a scorched hawthorn beyond this was another arm of the burning forest with yellow tongues already writhing from it completely encircling the space with a fence of fire upon the hill side were some thirty or forty morlocks dazzled by the light and heat and blundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment at first i did not realize their blindness and struck furiously at them with my bar in a frenzy of fear as they approached me killing one and crippling several more but when i had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky and heard their moans i was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare and i struck no more of them yet every now and then one would come straight towards me setting loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him at one time the flames died down somewhat and i feared the foul creatures would presently be able to see me i was thinking of beginning the fight by killing some of them before this should happen but the fire burst out again brightly and i stayed my hand i walked about the hill among them and avoided them looking for some trace of weena but weena was gone at last i sat down on the summit of the hillock and watched this strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro and making uncanny noises to each other as the glare of the fire beat on them the coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky and through the rare tatters of that red canopy remote as though they belonged to another universe shone the little stars two or three morlocks came blundering into me and i drove them off with blows of my fists trembling as i did so for the most part of that night i was persuaded it was a nightmare i bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake i beat the ground with my hands and got up and sat down again and wandered here and there and again sat down then i would fall to rubbing my eyes and calling upon god to let me awake thrice i saw morlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the flames but at last above the subsiding red of the fire above the streaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures came the white light of the day i searched again for traces of weena but there were none it was plain that they had left her poor little body in the forest i cannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate to which it seemed destined as i thought of that i was almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me but i contained myself the hillock as i have said was a kind of island in the forest from its summit i could now make out through a haze of smoke the palace of green porcelain and from that i could get my bearings for the white sphinx and so leaving the remnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and moaning as the day grew clearer i tied some grass about my feet and limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems that still pulsated internally with fire towards the hiding place of the time machine i walked slowly for i was almost exhausted as well as lame and i felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death of little weena it seemed an overwhelming calamity now in this old familiar room it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss but that morning it left me absolutely lonely again terribly alone i began to think of this house of mine of this fireside of some of you and with such thoughts came a longing that was pain but as i walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky i made a discovery in my trouser pocket were still some loose matches the box must have leaked before it was lost x about eight or nine in the morning i came to the same seat of yellow metal from which i had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival i thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and could not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence here was the same beautiful scene the same abundant foliage the same splendid palaces and magnificent ruins the same silver river running between its fertile banks the gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and thither among the trees some were bathing in exactly the place where i had saved weena and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain and like blots upon the landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the under world i understood now what all the beauty of the over world people covered very pleasant was their day as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field like the cattle they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs and their end was the same i grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had been it had committed suicide it had set itself steadfastly towards comfort and ease a balanced society with security and permanency as its watchword it had attained its hopes to come to this at last once life and property must have reached almost absolute safety the rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort the toiler assured of his life and work no doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem no social question left unsolved and a great quiet had followed it is a law of nature we overlook that intellectual versatility is the compensation for change danger and trouble an animal perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless there is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change only those animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety of needs and dangers so as i see it the upper world man had drifted towards his feeble prettiness and the under world to mere mechanical industry but that perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical perfection absolute permanency apparently as time went on the feeding of the under world however it was effected had become disjointed mother necessity who had been staved off for a few thousand years came back again and she began below the under world being in contact with machinery which however perfect still needs some little thought outside habit had probably retained perforce rather more initiative if less of every other human character than the upper and when other meat failed them they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden so i say i saw it in my last view of the world of eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one it may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit could invent it is how the thing shaped itself to me and as that i give it to you after the fatigues excitements and terrors of the past days and in spite of my grief this seat and the tranquil view and the warm sunlight were very pleasant i was very tired and sleepy and soon my theorizing passed into dozing catching myself at that i took my own hint and spreading myself out upon the turf i had a long and refreshing sleep i awoke a little before sunsetting i now felt safe against being caught napping by the morlocks and stretching myself i came on down the hill towards the white sphinx i had my crowbar in one hand and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket and now came a most unexpected thing as i approached the pedestal of the sphinx i found the bronze valves were open they had slid down into grooves at that i stopped short before them hesitating to enter within was a small apartment and on a raised place in the corner of this was the time machine i had the small levers in my pocket so here after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the white sphinx was a meek surrender i threw my iron bar away almost sorry not to use it a sudden thought came into my head as i stooped towards the portal for once at least i grasped the mental operations of the morlocks suppressing a strong inclination to laugh i stepped through the bronze frame and up to the time machine i was surprised to find it had been carefully oiled and cleaned i have suspected since that the morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose now as i stood and examined it finding a pleasure in the mere touch of the contrivance the thing i had expected happened the bronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang i was in the dark trapped so the morlocks thought at that i chuckled gleefully i could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me very calmly i tried to strike the match i had only to fix on the levers and depart then like a ghost but i had overlooked one little thing the matches were of that abominable kind that light only on the box you may imagine how all my calm vanished the little brutes were close upon me one touched me i made a sweeping blow in the dark at them with the levers and began to scramble into the saddle of the machine then came one hand upon me and then another then i had simply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers and at the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted one indeed they almost got away from me as it slipped from my hand i had to butt in the dark with my head i could hear the morlock s skull ring to recover it it was a nearer thing than the fight in the forest i think this last scramble but at last the lever was fitted and pulled over the clinging hands slipped from me the darkness presently fell from my eyes i found myself in the same grey light and tumult i have already described xi i have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with time travelling and this time i was not seated properly in the saddle but sideways and in an unstable fashion for an indefinite time i clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated quite unheeding how i went and when i brought myself to look at the dials again i was amazed to find where i had arrived one dial records days and another thousands of days another millions of days and another thousands of millions now instead of reversing the levers i had pulled them over so as to go forward with them and when i came to look at these indicators i found that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch into futurity as i drove on a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things the palpitating greyness grew darker then though i was still travelling with prodigious velocity the blinking succession of day and night which was usually indicative of a slower pace returned and grew more and more marked this puzzled me very much at first the alternations of night and day grew slower and slower and so did the passage of the sun across the sky until they seemed to stretch through centuries at last a steady twilight brooded over the earth a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky the band of light that had indicated the sun had long since disappeared for the sun had ceased to set it simply rose and fell in the west and grew ever broader and more red all trace of the moon had vanished the circling of the stars growing slower and slower had given place to creeping points of light at last some time before i stopped the sun red and very large halted motionless upon the horizon a vast dome glowing with a dull heat and now and then suffering a momentary extinction at one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat i perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal drag was done the earth had come to rest with one face to the sun even as in our own time the moon faces the earth very cautiously for i remembered my former headlong fall i began to reverse my motion slower and slower went the circling hands until the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a mere mist upon its scale still slower until the dim outlines of a desolate beach grew visible i stopped very gently and sat upon the time machine looking round the sky was no longer blue north eastward it was inky black and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars overhead it was a deep indian red and starless and south eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where cut by the horizon lay the huge hull of the sun red and motionless the rocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour and all the trace of life that i could see at first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting point on their south eastern face it was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves plants which like these grow in a perpetual twilight the machine was standing on a sloping beach the sea stretched away to the south west to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky there were no breakers and no waves for not a breath of wind was stirring only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living and along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of salt pink under the lurid sky there was a sense of oppression in my head and i noticed that i was breathing very fast the sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering and from that i judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now far away up the desolate slope i heard a harsh scream and saw a thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and circling disappear over some low hillocks beyond the sound of its voice was so dismal that i shivered and seated myself more firmly upon the machine looking round me again i saw that quite near what i had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me then i saw the thing was really a monstrous crab like creature can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly its big claws swaying its long antennae like carters whips waving and feeling and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic front its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there i could see the many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it moved as i stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me i felt a tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there i tried to brush it away with my hand but in a moment it returned and almost immediately came another by my ear i struck at this and caught something threadlike it was drawn swiftly out of my hand with a frightful qualm i turned and i saw that i had grasped the antenna of another monster crab that stood just behind me its evil eyes were wriggling on their stalks its mouth was all alive with appetite and its vast ungainly claws smeared with an algal slime were descending upon me in a moment my hand was on the lever and i had placed a month between myself and these monsters but i was still on the same beach and i saw them distinctly now as soon as i stopped dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there in the sombre light among the foliated sheets of intense green i cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the world the red eastern sky the northward blackness the salt dead sea the stony beach crawling with these foul slow stirring monsters the uniform poisonous looking green of the lichenous plants the thin air that hurts one s lungs all contributed to an appalling effect i moved on a hundred years and there was the same red sun a little larger a little duller the same dying sea the same chill air and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and the red rocks and in the westward sky i saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon so i travelled stopping ever and again in great strides of a thousand years or more drawn on by the mystery of the earth s fate watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in the westward sky and the life of the old earth ebb away at last more than thirty million years hence the huge red hot dome of the sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens then i stopped once more for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared and the red beach save for its livid green liverworts and lichens seemed lifeless and now it was flecked with white a bitter cold assailed me rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down to the north eastward the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable sky and i could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white there were fringes of ice along the sea margin with drifting masses further out but the main expanse of that salt ocean all bloody under the eternal sunset was still unfrozen i looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained a certain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the machine but i saw nothing moving in earth or sky or sea the green slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct a shallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the beach i fancied i saw some black object flopping about upon this bank but it became motionless as i looked at it and i judged that my eye had been deceived and that the black object was merely a rock the stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very little suddenly i noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had changed that a concavity a bay had appeared in the curve i saw this grow larger for a minute perhaps i stared aghast at this blackness that was creeping over the day and then i realized that an eclipse was beginning either the moon or the planet mercury was passing across the sun s disk naturally at first i took it to be the moon but there is much to incline me to believe that what i really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to the earth the darkness grew apace a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from the east and the showering white flakes in the air increased in number from the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent silent it would be hard to convey the stillness of it all the sounds of man the bleating of sheep the cries of birds the hum of insects the stir that makes the background of our lives all that was over as the darkness thickened the eddying flakes grew more abundant dancing before my eyes and the cold of the air more intense at last one by one swiftly one after the other the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into blackness the breeze rose to a moaning wind i saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me in another moment the pale stars alone were visible all else was rayless obscurity the sky was absolutely black a horror of this great darkness came on me the cold that smote to my marrow and the pain i felt in breathing overcame me i shivered and a deadly nausea seized me then like a red hot bow in the sky appeared the edge of the sun i got off the machine to recover myself i felt giddy and incapable of facing the return journey as i stood sick and confused i saw again the moving thing upon the shoal there was no mistake now that it was a moving thing against the red water of the sea it was a round thing the size of a football perhaps or it may be bigger and tentacles trailed down from it it seemed black against the weltering blood red water and it was hopping fitfully about then i felt i was fainting but a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote and awful twilight sustained me while i clambered upon the saddle xii so i came back for a long time i must have been insensible upon the machine the blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed the sun got golden again the sky blue i breathed with greater freedom the fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed the hands spun backward upon the dials at last i saw again the dim shadows of houses the evidences of decadent humanity these too changed and passed and others came presently when the million dial was at zero i slackened speed i began to recognize our own pretty and familiar architecture the thousands hand ran back to the starting point the night and day flapped slower and slower then the old walls of the laboratory came round me very gently now i slowed the mechanism down i saw one little thing that seemed odd to me i think i have told you that when i set out before my velocity became very high mrs watchett had walked across the room travelling as it seemed to me like a rocket as i returned i passed again across that minute when she traversed the laboratory but now her every motion appeared to be the exact inversion of her previous ones the door at the lower end opened and she glided quietly up the laboratory back foremost and disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered just before that i seemed to see hillyer for a moment but he passed like a flash then i stopped the machine and saw about me again the old familiar laboratory my tools my appliances just as i had left them i got off the thing very shakily and sat down upon my bench for several minutes i trembled violently then i became calmer around me was my old workshop again exactly as it had been i might have slept there and the whole thing have been a dream and yet not exactly the thing had started from the south east corner of the laboratory it had come to rest again in the north west against the wall where you saw it that gives you the exact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the white sphinx into which the morlocks had carried my machine for a time my brain went stagnant presently i got up and came through the passage here limping because my heel was still painful and feeling sorely begrimed i saw the pall mall gazette on the table by the door i found the date was indeed to day and looking at the timepiece saw the hour was almost eight o clock i heard your voices and the clatter of plates i hesitated i felt so sick and weak then i sniffed good wholesome meat and opened the door on you you know the rest i washed and dined and now i am telling you the story i know he said after a pause that all this will be absolutely incredible to you to me the one incredible thing is that i am here to night in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces and telling you these strange adventures he looked at the medical man no i cannot expect you to believe it take it as a lie or a prophecy say i dreamed it in the workshop consider i have been speculating upon the destinies of our race until i have hatched this fiction treat my assertion of its truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest and taking it as a story what do you think of it he took up his pipe and began in his old accustomed manner to tap with it nervously upon the bars of the grate there was a momentary stillness then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the carpet i took my eyes off the time traveller s face and looked round at his audience they were in the dark and little spots of colour swam before them the medical man seemed absorbed in the contemplation of our host the editor was looking hard at the end of his cigar the sixth the journalist fumbled for his watch the others as far as i remember were motionless the editor stood up with a sigh what a pity it is you re not a writer of stories he said putting his hand on the time traveller s shoulder you don t believe it well i thought not the time traveller turned to us where are the matches he said he lit one and spoke over his pipe puffing to tell you the truth i hardly believe it myself and yet his eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon the little table then he turned over the hand holding his pipe and i saw he was looking at some half healed scars on his knuckles the medical man rose came to the lamp and examined the flowers the gynaeceum s odd he said the psychologist leant forward to see holding out his hand for a specimen i m hanged if it isn t a quarter to one said the journalist how shall we get home plenty of cabs at the station said the psychologist it s a curious thing said the medical man but i certainly don t know the natural order of these flowers may i have them the time traveller hesitated then suddenly certainly not where did you really get them said the medical man the time traveller put his hand to his head he spoke like one who was trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him they were put into my pocket by weena when i travelled into time he stared round the room i m damned if it isn t all going this room and you and the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory did i ever make a time machine or a model of a time machine or is it all only a dream they say life is a dream a precious poor dream at times but i can t stand another that won t fit it s madness and where did the dream come from i must look at that machine if there is one he caught up the lamp swiftly and carried it flaring red through the door into the corridor we followed him there in the flickering light of the lamp was the machine sure enough squat ugly and askew a thing of brass ebony ivory and translucent glimmering quartz solid to the touch for i put out my hand and felt the rail of it and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory and bits of grass and moss upon the lower parts and one rail bent awry the time traveller put the lamp down on the bench and ran his hand along the damaged rail it s all right now he said the story i told you was true i m sorry to have brought you out here in the cold he took up the lamp and in an absolute silence we returned to the smoking room he came into the hall with us and helped the editor on with his coat the medical man looked into his face and with a certain hesitation told him he was suffering from overwork at which he laughed hugely i remember him standing in the open doorway bawling good night i shared a cab with the editor he thought the tale a gaudy lie for my own part i was unable to come to a conclusion the story was so fantastic and incredible the telling so credible and sober i lay awake most of the night thinking about it i determined to go next day and see the time traveller again i was told he was in the laboratory and being on easy terms in the house i went up to him the laboratory however was empty i stared for a minute at the time machine and put out my hand and touched the lever at that the squat substantial looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind its instability startled me extremely and i had a queer reminiscence of the childish days when i used to be forbidden to meddle i came back through the corridor the time traveller met me in the smoking room he was coming from the house he had a small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other he laughed when he saw me and gave me an elbow to shake i m frightfully busy said he with that thing in there but is it not some hoax i said do you really travel through time really and truly i do and he looked frankly into my eyes he hesitated his eye wandered about the room i only want half an hour he said i know why you came and it s awfully good of you there s some magazines here if you ll stop to lunch i ll prove you this time travelling up to the hilt specimen and all if you ll forgive my leaving you now i consented hardly comprehending then the full import of his words and he nodded and went on down the corridor i heard the door of the laboratory slam seated myself in a chair and took up a daily paper what was he going to do before lunch time then suddenly i was reminded by an advertisement that i had promised to meet richardson the publisher at two i looked at my watch and saw that i could barely save that engagement i got up and went down the passage to tell the time traveller as i took hold of the handle of the door i heard an exclamation oddly truncated at the end and a click and a thud a gust of air whirled round me as i opened the door and from within came the sound of broken glass falling on the floor the time traveller was not there i seemed to see a ghostly indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black and brass for a moment a figure so transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct but this phantasm vanished as i rubbed my eyes the time machine had gone save for a subsiding stir of dust the further end of the laboratory was empty a pane of the skylight had apparently just been blown in i felt an unreasonable amazement i knew that something strange had happened and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing might be as i stood staring the door into the garden opened and the man servant appeared we looked at each other then ideas began to come has mr gone out that way said i no sir no one has come out this way i was expecting to find him here at that i understood at the risk of disappointing richardson i stayed on waiting for the time traveller waiting for the second perhaps still stranger story and the specimens and photographs he would bring with him but i am beginning now to fear that i must wait a lifetime the time traveller vanished three years ago and as everybody knows now he has never returned epilogue one cannot choose but wonder will he ever return it may be that he swept back into the past and fell among the blood drinking hairy savages of the age of unpolished stone into the abysses of the cretaceous sea or among the grotesque saurians the huge reptilian brutes of the jurassic times he may even now if i may use the phrase be wandering on some plesiosaurus haunted oolitic coral reef or beside the lonely saline lakes of the triassic age or did he go forward into one of the nearer ages in which men are still men but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome problems solved into the manhood of the race for i for my own part cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment fragmentary theory and mutual discord are indeed man s culminating time i say for my own part he i know for the question had been discussed among us long before the time machine was made thought but cheerlessly of the advancement of mankind and saw in the growing pile of civilization only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end if that is so it remains for us to live as though it were not so but to me the future is still black and blank is a vast ignorance lit at a few casual places by the memory of his story and i have by me for my comfort two strange white flowers shrivelled now and brown and flat and brittle to witness that even when mind and strength had gone gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of man '"

But still more welcome is the change in the\\nattitude of the educated world towards the old-time alchemists and their\\ntheories which has taken place during the past few years.\\n\\nThe theory of the origin of Alchemy put forward in Chapter I has led to\\nconsiderable discussion; but whilst this theory has met with general\\nacceptance, some of its earlier critics took it as implying far more\\nthan is actually the case. As a result of further research my conviction\\nof its truth has become more fully confirmed, and in my recent work\\nentitled _Bygone Beliefs_ (Rider, 1920), under the title of “The Quest\\nof the Philosopher’s Stone,” I have found it possible to adduce further\\nevidence in this connection. At the same time, whilst I became\\nincreasingly convinced that the main alchemistic hypotheses were drawn\\nfrom the domain of mystical theology and applied to physics and\\nchemistry by way of analogy, it also became evident to me that the crude\\nphysiology of bygone ages and remnants of the old phallic faith formed a\\nfurther and subsidiary source of alchemistic theory. I have barely, if\\nat all, touched on this matter in the present work; the reader who is\\ninterested will find it dealt with in some detail in “The Phallic\\nElement in Alchemical Doctrine” in my _Bygone Beliefs_.\\n\\nIn view of recent research in the domain of Radioactivity and the\\nconsequent advance in knowledge that has resulted since this book was\\nfirst published, I have carefully considered the advisability of\\nrewriting the whole of the last chapter, but came to the conclusion that\\nthe time for this was not yet ripe, and that, apart from a few minor\\nemendations, the chapter had better remain very much as it originally\\nstood. My reason for this course was that, whilst considerably more is\\nknown to-day, than was the case in 1911, concerning the very complex\\ntransmutations undergone spontaneously by the radioactive\\nelements--knowledge helping further to elucidate the problem of the\\nconstitution of the so-called “elements” of the chemist--the problem\\nreally cognate to my subject, namely that of effecting a transmutation\\nof one element into another at will, remains in almost the same state of\\nindeterminateness as in 1911. In 1913, Sir William Ramsay[1] thought he\\nhad obtained evidence for the transmutation of hydrogen into helium by\\nthe action of the electric discharge, and Professors Collie and\\nPatterson[2] thought they had obtained evidence of the transmutation of\\nhydrogen into neon by similar means. But these observations (as well as\\nSir William Ramsay’s earlier transmutational experiments) failed to be\\nsatisfactorily confirmed;[3] and since the death of the latter, little,\\nif anything, appears to have been done to settle the questions raised by\\nhis experiments. Reference must, however, be made to a very interesting\\ninvestigation by Sir Ernest Rutherford on the “Collision of α-Particles\\nwith Light Atoms,”[4] from which it appears certain that when bombarded\\nwith the swiftly-moving α-particles given off by radium-C, the atoms of\\nnitrogen may be disintegrated, one of the products being hydrogen. The\\nother product is possibly helium,[5] though this has not been proved. In\\nview of Rutherford’s results a further repetition of Ramsay’s\\nexperiments would certainly appear to be advisable.\\n\\n    [1] See his “The Presence of Helium in the Gas from the Interior of\\n    an X-Ray Bulb,” _Journal of the Chemical Society_, vol. ciii.\\n    (1913), pp. 264 _et seq._\\n\\n    [2] See their “The Presence of Neon in Hydrogen after the Passage of\\n    the Electric Discharge through the latter at Low Pressures,”\\n    _ibid._, pp. 419 _et seq._; and “The Production of Neon and Helium\\n    by the Electric Discharge,” _Proceedings of the Royal Society_, _A_,\\n    vol. xci. (1915), pp. 30 _et seq._\\n\\n    [3] See especially the report of negative experiments by Mr. A. C.\\n    G. Egerton, published in _Proceedings of the Royal Society_, _A_,\\n    vol. xci. (1915), pp. 180 _et seq._\\n\\n    [4] See the _Philosophical Magazine_ for June, 1919, 6th Series,\\n    vol. xxxvii. pp. 537-587.\\n\\n    [5] Or perhaps an isotope of helium (see below).\\n\\nAs concerns the spontaneous transmutations undergone by the radioactive\\nelements, the facts appear to indicate (or, at least, can be brought\\ninto some sort of order by supposing) the atom to consist of a central\\nnucleus and an outer shell, as suggested by Sir Ernest Rutherford. The\\nnucleus may be compared to the sun of a solar system. It is excessively\\nsmall, but in it the mass of the atom is almost entirely concentrated.\\nIt is positively charged, the charge being neutralised by that of the\\nfree electrons which revolve like planets about it, and which by their\\norbits account for the volume of the atom. The atomic weight of the\\nelement depends upon the central sun; but the chemical properties of the\\nelement are determined by the number of electrons in the shell; this\\nnumber is the same as that representing the position of the element in\\nthe periodic system. Radioactive change originates in the atomic\\nnucleus. The expulsion of an α-particle therefrom decreases the atomic\\nweight by 4 units, necessitates (since the α-particle carries two\\npositive charges) the removal of two electrons from the shell in order\\nto maintain electrical neutrality, and hence changes the chemical nature\\nof the body, transmuting the element into one occupying a position two\\nplaces to the left in the periodic system (for example, the change of\\nradium into niton). But radioactivity sometimes results in the expulsion\\nof a β-particle from the nucleus. This results in the addition of an\\nelectron to the shell, and hence changes the chemical character of the\\nelement, transmuting it into one occupying a position one place to the\\nright in the periodic system, but _without altering its atomic weight_.\\nConsequently, the expulsion of one α- and two β-particles from the\\nnucleus, whilst decreasing the atomic weight of the element by 4, leaves\\nthe number of electrons in the shell, and thus the chemical properties\\nof the element, unaltered. These remarkable conclusions are amply borne\\nout by the facts, and the discovery of elements (called “isobares”)\\nhaving the same atomic weight but different chemical properties, and of\\nthose (called “isotopes”) having identical chemical characters but\\ndifferent atomic weights, must be regarded as one of the most\\nsignificant and important discoveries of recent years. Some further\\nreference to this theory will be found in §§ 77 and 81: the reader who\\nwishes to follow the matter further should consult the fourth edition of\\nProfessor Frederick Soddy’s _The Interpretation of Radium_ (1920), and\\nthe two chapters on the subject in his _Science and Life_ (1920), one of\\nwhich is a popular exposition and the other a more technical one.\\n\\nThese advances in knowledge all point to the possibility of effecting\\ntransmutations at will, but so far attempts to achieve this, as I have\\nalready indicated, cannot be regarded as altogether satisfactory.\\nSeveral methods of making gold, or rather elements chemically identical\\nwith gold, once the method of controlling radioactive change is\\ndiscovered (as assuredly it will be) are suggested by Sir Ernest\\nRutherford’s theory of the nuclear atom. Thus, the expulsion of two\\nα-particles from bismuth or one from thallium would yield the required\\nresult. Or lead could be converted into mercury by the expulsion of one\\nα-particle, and this into thallium by the expulsion of one β-particle,\\nyielding gold by the further expulsion of an α-particle. But, as\\nProfessor Soddy remarks in his _Science and Life_ just referred to, “if\\nman ever achieves this further control over Nature, it is quite certain\\nthat the last thing he would want to do would be to turn lead or mercury\\ninto gold--_for the sake of gold_. The energy that would be liberated,\\nif the control of these sub-atomic processes were as possible as is the\\ncontrol of ordinary chemical changes, such as combustion, would far\\nexceed in importance and value the gold. Rather it would pay to\\ntransmute gold into silver or some base metal.”\\n\\nIn § 101 of the book I suggest that the question of the effect on the\\nworld of finance of the discovery of an inexpensive method of\\ntransmuting base metal into gold on a large scale is one that should\\nappeal to a novelist specially gifted with imagination. Since the words\\nwere first written a work has appeared in which something approximating\\nto what was suggested has been attempted and very admirably achieved. My\\nreference is to Mr. H. G. Wells’s novel, _The World Set Free_, published\\nin 1914.\\n\\nIn conclusion I should like to thank the very many reviewers who found\\nso many good things to say concerning the first edition of this book.\\nFor kind assistance in reading the proofs of this edition my best thanks\\nare due also and are hereby tendered to my wife, and my good friend\\nGerald Druce, Esq., M.Sc.\\n\\n  H. S. R.\\n\\n  191, CAMDEN ROAD, LONDON, N.W. 1.\\n  _October_, 1921.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE\\n\\n\\nThe number of books in the English language dealing with the interesting\\nsubject of Alchemy is not sufficiently great to render an apology\\nnecessary for adding thereto. Indeed, at the present time there is an\\nactual need for a further contribution on this subject. The time is gone\\nwhen it was regarded as perfectly legitimate to point to Alchemy as an\\ninstance of the aberrations of the human mind. Recent experimental\\nresearch has brought about profound modifications in the scientific\\nnotions regarding the chemical elements, and, indeed, in the scientific\\nconcept of the physical universe itself; and a certain resemblance can\\nbe traced between these later views and the theories of bygone Alchemy.\\nThe spontaneous change of one “element” into another has been witnessed,\\nand the recent work of Sir William Ramsay suggests the possibility of\\nrealising the old alchemistic dream--the transmutation of the “base”\\nmetals into gold.\\n\\nThe basic idea permeating all the alchemistic theories appears to have\\nbeen this: All the metals (and, indeed, all forms of matter) are one in\\norigin, and are produced by an evolutionary process. The Soul of them\\nall is one and the same; it is only the Soul that is permanent; the\\nbody or outward form, _i.e._, the mode of manifestation of the Soul, is\\ntransitory, and one form may be transmuted into another. The similarity,\\nindeed it might be said, the identity, between this view and the modern\\netheric theory of matter is at once apparent.\\n\\nThe old alchemists reached the above conclusion by a theoretical method,\\nand attempted to demonstrate the validity of their theory by means of\\nexperiment; in which, it appears, they failed. Modern science, adopting\\nthe reverse process, for a time lost hold of the idea of the unity of\\nthe physical universe, to gain it once again by the experimental method.\\nIt was in the elaboration of this grand fundamental idea that Alchemy\\nfailed. If I were asked to contrast Alchemy with the chemical and\\nphysical science of the nineteenth century I would say that, whereas the\\nlatter abounded in a wealth of much accurate detail and much relative\\ntruth, it lacked philosophical depth and insight; whilst Alchemy,\\ndeficient in such accurate detail, was characterised by a greater degree\\nof philosophical depth and insight; for the alchemists did grasp the\\nfundamental truth of the Cosmos, although they distorted it and made it\\nappear grotesque. The alchemists cast their theories in a mould entirely\\nfantastic, even ridiculous--they drew unwarrantable analogies--and hence\\ntheir views cannot be accepted in these days of modern science. But if\\nwe cannot approve of their theories _in toto_, we can nevertheless\\nappreciate the fundamental ideas at the root of them. And it is\\nprimarily with the object of pointing out this similarity between these\\nancient ideas regarding the physical universe and the latest products\\nof scientific thought, that this book has been written.\\n\\nIt is a regrettable fact that the majority of works dealing with the\\nsubject of Alchemy take a one-sided point of view. The chemists\\ngenerally take a purely physical view of the subject, and instead of\\ntrying to understand its mystical language, often (I do not say always)\\nprefer to label it nonsense and the alchemist a fool. On the other hand,\\nthe mystics, in many cases, take a purely transcendental view of the\\nsubject, forgetting the fact that the alchemists were, for the most\\npart, concerned with operations of a physical nature. For a proper\\nunderstanding of Alchemy, as I hope to make plain in the first chapter\\nof this work, a synthesis of both points of view is essential; and,\\nsince these two aspects are so intimately and essentially connected with\\none another, this is necessary even when, as in the following work, one\\nis concerned primarily with the physical, rather than the purely\\nmystical, aspect of the subject.\\n\\nNow, the author of this book may lay claim to being a humble student of\\nboth Chemistry and what may be generalised under the terms Mysticism and\\nTranscendentalism; and he hopes that this perhaps rather unusual\\ncombination of studies has enabled him to take a broad-minded view of\\nthe theories of the alchemists, and to adopt a sympathetic attitude\\ntowards them.\\n\\nWith regard to the illustrations, the author must express his thanks to\\nthe authorities of the British Museum for permission to photograph\\nengraved portraits and illustrations from old works in the British\\nMuseum Collections, and to G. H. Gabb, Esq., F.C.S., for permission to\\nphotograph engraved portraits in his possession.\\n\\nThe author’s heartiest thanks are also due to Frank E. Weston, Esq.,\\nB.Sc., F.C.S., and W. G.

Alchemy\\nwas both a philosophy and an experimental science, and the transmutation\\nof the metals was its end only in that this would give the final proof\\nof the alchemistic hypotheses; in other words, Alchemy, considered from\\nthe physical standpoint, was the attempt to demonstrate experimentally\\non the material plane the validity of a certain philosophical view of\\nthe Cosmos. We see the genuine scientific spirit in the saying of one of\\nthe alchemists: “Would to God .\\xa0.\\xa0. all men might become adepts in our\\nArt--for then gold, the great idol of mankind, would lose its value, and\\nwe should prize it only for its scientific teaching.”[6] Unfortunately,\\nhowever, not many alchemists came up to this ideal; and for the majority\\nof them, Alchemy did mean merely the possibility of making gold cheaply\\nand gaining untold wealth.\\n\\n    [6] “EIRENÆUS PHILALETHES”: _An Open Entrance to the Closed Palace\\n    of the King_ (see _The Hermetic Museum, Restored and Enlarged_,\\n    edited by A. E. Waite, 1893, vol. ii. p. 178).\\n\\n\\nThe Transcendental Theory of Alchemy.\\n\\n§ =2.= By some mystics, however, the opinion has been expressed that\\nAlchemy was not a physical art or science at all, that in no sense was\\nits object the manufacture of material gold, and that its processes were\\nnot carried out on the physical plane. According to this transcendental\\ntheory, Alchemy was concerned with man’s soul, its object was the\\nperfection, not of material substances, but of man in a spiritual sense.\\nThose who hold this view identify Alchemy with, or at least regard it as\\na branch of, Mysticism, from which it is supposed to differ merely by\\nthe employment of a special language; and they hold that the writings of\\nthe alchemists must not be understood literally as dealing with chemical\\noperations, with furnaces, retorts, alembics, pelicans and the like,\\nwith salt, sulphur, mercury, gold and other material substances, but\\nmust be understood as grand allegories dealing with spiritual truths.\\nAccording to this view, the figure of the transmutation of the “base”\\nmetals into gold symbolised the salvation of man--the transmutation of\\nhis soul into spiritual gold--which was to be obtained by the\\nelimination of evil and the development of good by the grace of God; and\\nthe realisation of which salvation or spiritual transmutation may be\\ndescribed as the New Birth, or that condition of being known as union\\nwith the Divine. It would follow, of course, if this theory were true,\\nthat the genuine alchemists were pure mystics, and hence, that the\\ndevelopment of chemical science was not due to their labours, but to\\npseudo-alchemists who so far misunderstood their writings as to have\\ninterpreted them in a literal sense.\\n\\n\\nFailure of the Transcendental Theory.\\n\\n§ =3.= This theory, however, has been effectively disposed of by Mr.\\nArthur Edward Waite, who points to the lives of the alchemists\\nthemselves in refutation of it. For their lives indisputably prove that\\nthe alchemists were occupied with chemical operations on the physical\\nplane, and that for whatever motive, they toiled to discover a method\\nfor transmuting the commoner metals into actual, material gold. As\\nParacelsus himself says of the true “spagyric physicians,” who were the\\nalchemists of his period: “These do not give themselves up to ease and\\nidleness .\\xa0.\\xa0. But they devote themselves diligently to their labours,\\nsweating whole nights over fiery furnaces. These do not kill the time\\nwith empty talk, but find their delight in their laboratory.”[7] The\\nwritings of the alchemists contain (mixed, however, with much that from\\nthe physical standpoint appears merely fantastic) accurate accounts of\\nmany chemical processes and discoveries, which cannot be explained away\\nby any method of transcendental interpretation. There is not the\\nslightest doubt that chemistry owes its origin to the direct labours of\\nthe alchemists themselves, and not to any who misread their writings.\\n\\n    [7] PARACELSUS: “Concerning the Nature of Things” (see _The Hermetic\\n    and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus_, edited by A. E. Waite, 1894,\\n    vol. i. p. 167).\\n\\n\\nThe Qualifications of the Adept.\\n\\n§ =4.= At the same time, it is quite evident that there is a\\nconsiderable element of Mysticism in the alchemistic doctrines; this has\\nalways been recognised; but, as a general rule, those who have\\napproached the subject from the scientific point of view have considered\\nthis mystical element as of little or no importance. However, there are\\ncertain curious facts which are not satisfactorily explained by a purely\\nphysical theory of Alchemy, and, in our opinion, the recognition of the\\nimportance of this mystical element and of the true relation which\\nexisted between Alchemy and Mysticism is essential for the right\\nunderstanding of the subject. We may notice, in the first place, that\\nthe alchemists always speak of their Art as a Divine Gift, the highest\\nsecrets of which are not to be learnt from any books on the subject; and\\nthey invariably teach that the right mental attitude with regard to God\\nis the first step necessary for the achievement of the _magnum opus_. As\\nsays one alchemist: “In the first place, let every devout and\\nGod-fearing chemist and student of this Art consider that this arcanum\\nshould be regarded, not only as a truly great, but as a most holy Art\\n(seeing that it typifies and shadows out the highest heavenly good).\\nTherefore, if any man desire to reach this great and unspeakable\\nMystery, he must remember that it is obtained not by the might of man,\\nbut by the grace of God, and that not our will or desire, but only the\\nmercy of the Most High, can bestow it upon us. For this reason you must\\nfirst of all cleanse your heart, lift it up to Him alone, and ask of\\nHim this gift in true, earnest, and undoubting prayer. He alone can give\\nand bestow it.”[8] And “Basil Valentine”: “First, there should be the\\ninvocation of God, flowing from the depth of a pure and sincere heart,\\nand a conscience which should be free from all ambition, hypocrisy, and\\nvice, as also from all cognate faults, such as arrogance, boldness,\\npride, luxury, worldly vanity, oppression of the poor, and similar\\niniquities, which should all be rooted up out of the heart--that when a\\nman appears before the Throne of Grace, to regain the health of his\\nbody, he may come with a conscience weeded of all tares, and be changed\\ninto a pure temple of God cleansed of all that defiles.”[9]\\n\\n    [8] _The Sophic Hydrolith; or, Water Stone of the Wise_ (see _The\\n    Hermetic Museum_, vol. i. p. 74).\\n\\n    [9] _The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony_ (Mr. A. E. Waite’s\\n    translation, p. 13). See § 41.\\n\\n\\nAlchemistic Language.\\n\\n§ =5.= In the second place, we must notice the nature of alchemistic\\nlanguage. As we have hinted above, and as is at once apparent on opening\\nany alchemistic book, the language of Alchemy is very highly mystical,\\nand there is much that is perfectly unintelligible in a physical sense.\\nIndeed, the alchemists habitually apologise for their vagueness on the\\nplea that such mighty secrets may not be made more fully manifest. It is\\ntrue, of course, that in the days of Alchemy’s degeneracy a good deal of\\npseudo-mystical nonsense was written by the many impostors then\\nabounding, but the mystical style of language is by no means confined to\\nthe later alchemistic writings. It is also true that the alchemists, no\\ndoubt, desired to shield their secrets from vulgar and profane eyes, and\\nhence would necessarily adopt a symbolic language. But it is past belief\\nthat the language of the alchemist was due to some arbitrary plan;\\nwhatever it is to us, it was very real to him. Moreover, this argument\\ncuts both ways, for those, also, who take a transcendental view of\\nAlchemy regard its language as symbolical, although after a different\\nmanner. It is also, to say the least, curious, as Mr. A. E. Waite points\\nout, that this mystical element should be found in the writings of the\\nearlier alchemists, whose manuscripts were not written for publication,\\nand therefore ran no risk of informing the vulgar of the precious\\nsecrets of Alchemy. On the other hand, the transcendental method of\\ntranslation does often succeed in making sense out of what is otherwise\\nunintelligible in the writings of the alchemists. The above-mentioned\\nwriter remarks on this point: “Without in any way pretending to assert\\nthat this hypothesis reduces the literary chaos of the philosophers into\\na regular order, it may be affirmed that it materially elucidates their\\nwritings, and that it is wonderful how contradictions, absurdities, and\\ndifficulties seem to dissolve wherever it is applied.”[10]\\n\\n    [10] ARTHUR EDWARD WAITE: _The Occult Sciences_ (1891), p. 91.\\n\\nThe alchemists’ love of symbolism is also conspicuously displayed in the\\ncurious designs with which certain of their books are embellished. We\\nare not here referring to the illustrations of actual apparatus employed\\nin carrying out the various operations of physical Alchemy, which are\\nnot infrequently found in the works of those alchemists who at the same\\ntime were practical chemists (Glauber, for example), but to pictures\\nwhose meaning plainly lies not upon the surface and whose import is\\nclearly symbolical, whether their symbolism has reference to physical or\\nto spiritual processes. Examples of such symbolic illustrations, many of\\nwhich are highly fantastic, will be found in plates 2, 3, and 4. We\\nshall refer to them again in the course of the present and following\\nchapters.\\n\\n\\nAlchemists of a Mystical Type.\\n\\n§ =6.= We must also notice that, although there cannot be the slightest\\ndoubt that the great majority of alchemists were engaged in problems and\\nexperiments of a physical nature, yet there were a few men included\\nwithin the alchemistic ranks who were entirely, or almost entirely,\\nconcerned with problems of a spiritual nature; Thomas Vaughan, for\\nexample, and Jacob Boehme, who boldly employed the language of Alchemy\\nin the elaboration of his system of mystical philosophy. And\\nparticularly must we notice, as Mr. A. E. Waite has also indicated, the\\nsignificant fact that the Western alchemists make unanimous appeal to\\nHermes Trismegistos as the greatest authority on the art of Alchemy,\\nwhose alleged writings are of an undoubtedly mystical character (see §\\n29). It is clear, that in spite of its apparently physical nature,\\nAlchemy must have been in some way closely connected with Mysticism.\\n\\n\\nThe Meaning of Alchemy.\\n\\n§ =7.= If we are ever to understand the meaning of Alchemy aright we\\nmust look at the subject from the alchemistic point of view. In modern\\ntimes there has come about a divorce between Religion and Science in\\nmen’s minds (though more recently a unifying tendency has set in); but\\nit was otherwise with the alchemists, their religion and their science\\nwere closely united. We have said that “Alchemy was the attempt to\\ndemonstrate experimentally on the material plane the validity of a\\ncertain philosophical view of the Cosmos”; now, this “philosophical view\\nof the Cosmos” was Mysticism. =Alchemy had its origin in the attempt to\\napply, in a certain manner, the principles of Mysticism to the things of\\nthe physical plane=, and was, therefore, of a dual nature, on the one\\nhand spiritual and religious, on the other, physical and material. As\\nthe anonymous author of _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_ (1815)\\nremarks, “The universal chemistry, by which the science of alchemy opens\\nthe knowledge of all nature, being founded on _first principles_ forms\\nanalogy with whatever knowledge is founded on the _same first\\nprinciples_.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. Saint John describes the redemption, or the new\\ncreation of the fallen soul, on the _same first principles_, until the\\nconsummation of the work, in which the Divine tincture transmutes the\\nbase metal of the soul into a perfection, that will pass the fire of\\neternity;”[11] that is to say, Alchemy and the mystical regeneration of\\nman (in this writer’s opinion) are analogous processes on different\\nplanes of being, because they are founded on the same first principles.\\n\\n    [11] F. B.: _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_ (1815), Preface,\\n    p. 3.\\n\\n\\nOpinions of other Writers.\\n\\n§ =8.= We shall here quote the opinions of two modern writers, as to the\\nsignificance of Alchemy; one a mystic, the other a man of science. Says\\nMr. A. E. Waite, “If the authors of the ‘Suggestive Inquiry’ and of\\n‘Remarks on Alchemy and the Alchemists’ [two books putting forward the\\ntranscendental theory] had considered the lives of the symbolists, as\\nwell as the nature of the symbols, their views would have been very much\\nmodified; they would have found that the true method of Hermetic\\ninterpretation lies in a middle course; but the errors which originated\\nwith merely typographical investigations were intensified by a\\nconsideration of the great alchemical theorem, which, _par excellence_,\\nis one of universal development, which acknowledges that every substance\\ncontains undeveloped resources and potentialities, and can be brought\\noutward and forward into perfection. They [the generality of alchemists]\\napplied their theory only to the development of metallic substances from\\na lower to a higher order, but we see by their writings that the grand\\nhierophants of Oriental and Western alchemy alike were continually\\nhaunted by brief and imperfect glimpses of glorious possibilities for\\nman, if the evolution of his nature were accomplished along the lines of\\ntheir theory.”[12] Mr. M. M. Pattison Muir, M.A., says: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. alchemy\\naimed at giving experimental proof of a certain theory of the whole\\nsystem of nature, including humanity. The practical culmination of the\\nalchemical quest presented a threefold aspect; the alchemists sought the\\nstone of wisdom, for by gaining that they gained the control of wealth;\\nthey sought the universal panacea, for that would give them the power of\\nenjoying wealth and life; they sought the soul of the world, for thereby\\nthey could hold communion with spiritual existences, and enjoy the\\nfruition of spiritual life. The object of their search was to satisfy\\ntheir material needs, their intellectual capacities, and their spiritual\\nyearnings. The alchemists of the nobler sort always made the first of\\nthese objects subsidiary to the other two. .\\xa0.\\xa0.”[13]\\n\\n    [12] ARTHUR EDWARD WAITE: _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_\\n    (1888), pp. 30, 31. As says another writer of the mystical school of\\n    thought: “If we look upon the subject [of Alchymy] from the point\\n    which affords the widest view, it may be said that Alchymy has two\\n    aspects: the simply material, and the religious. The dogma that\\n    Alchymy was only a form of chemistry is untenable by any one who has\\n    read the works of its chief professors. The doctrine that Alchymy\\n    was religion only, and that its chemical references were all blinds,\\n    is equally untenable in the face of history, which shows that many\\n    of its most noted professors were men who had made important\\n    discoveries in the domain of common chemistry, and were in no way\\n    notable as teachers either of ethics or religion” (“Sapere Aude,”\\n    _The Science of Alchymy, Spiritual and Material_ (1893), pp. 3 and\\n    4).\\n\\n    [13] M. M. PATTISON MUIR, M.A.: _The Story of Alchemy and the\\n    Beginnings of Chemistry_ (1902), pp. 105 and 106.\\n\\n\\nThe Basic Idea of Alchemy.\\n\\n§ =9.= The famous axiom beloved by every alchemist--“_What is above is\\nas that which is below, and what is below is as that which is\\nabove_”--although of questionable origin, tersely expresses the basic\\nidea of Alchemy. The alchemists postulated and believed in a very real\\nsense in the essential unity of the Cosmos. Hence, they held that there\\nis a correspondence or analogy existing between things spiritual and\\nthings physical, the same laws operating in each realm. As writes\\nSendivogius “.\\xa0.\\xa0. the Sages have been taught of God that this natural\\nworld is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual\\npattern; that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality\\nof its celestial archetype; and that God has created it in imitation of\\nthe spiritual and invisible universe, in order that men might be the\\nbetter enabled to comprehend His heavenly teaching, and the wonders of\\nHis absolute and ineffable power and wisdom. Thus the Sage sees heaven\\nreflected in Nature as in a mirror; and he pursues this Art, not for the\\nsake of gold or silver, but for the love of the knowledge which it\\nreveals; he jealously conceals it from the sinner and the scornful, lest\\nthe mysteries of heaven should be laid bare to the vulgar gaze.”[14]\\n\\n    [14] MICHAEL SENDIVOGIUS: _The New Chemical Light, Pt. II.,\\n    Concerning Sulphur_ (_The Hermetic Museum_, vol. ii. p. 138).\\n\\nThe alchemists held that the metals are one in essence, and spring from\\nthe same seed in the womb of nature, but are not all equally matured and\\nperfect, gold being the highest product of Nature’s powers. In gold, the\\nalchemist saw a picture of the regenerate man, resplendent with\\nspiritual beauty, overcoming all temptations and proof against evil;\\nwhilst he regarded lead--the basest of the metals--as typical of the\\nsinful and unregenerate man, stamped with the hideousness of sin and\\neasily overcome by temptation and evil; for whilst gold withstood the\\naction of fire and all known corrosive liquids (save _aqua regia_\\nalone), lead was most easily acted upon. We are told that the\\nPhilosopher’s Stone, which would bring about the desired grand\\ntransmutation, is of a species with gold itself and purer than the\\npurest; understood in the mystical sense this means that the\\nregeneration of man can be effected only by Goodness itself--in terms of\\nChristian theology, by the Power of the Spirit of Christ. The\\nPhilosopher’s Stone was regarded as symbolical of Christ Jesus, and in\\nthis sense we can understand the otherwise incredible powers attributed\\nto it.\\n\\n\\nThe Law of Analogy.\\n\\n§ =10.= With the theories of physical Alchemy we shall deal at length in\\nthe following chapter, but enough has been said to indicate the analogy\\nexisting, according to the alchemistic view, between the problem of the\\nperfection of the metals, _i.e._, the transmutation of the “base” metals\\ninto gold, and the perfection or transfiguration of spiritual man; and\\nit might also be added, between these problems and that of the\\nperfection of man considered physiologically. To the alchemistic\\nphilosopher these three problems were one: the same problem on different\\nplanes of being; and the solution was likewise one. He who held the key\\nto one problem held the key to all three, provided he understood the\\nanalogy between matter and spirit. The point is not, be it noted,\\nwhether these problems are in reality one and the same; the main\\ndoctrine of analogy, which is, indeed, an essential element in all true\\nmystical philosophy, will, we suppose, meet with general consent; but it\\nwill be contended (and rightly, we think) that the analogies drawn by\\nthe alchemists are fantastic and by no means always correct, though\\npossibly there may be more truth in them than appears at first sight.\\nThe point is not that these analogies are correct, but that they were\\nregarded as such by all true alchemists. Says the author of _The Sophic\\nHydrolith_: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. the practice of this Art enables us to understand,\\nnot merely the marvels of Nature, but the nature of God Himself, in all\\nits unspeakable glory. It shadows forth, in a wonderful manner .\\xa0.\\xa0. all\\nthe articles of the Christian faith, and the reason why man must pass\\nthrough much tribulation and anguish, and fall a prey to death, before\\nhe can rise again to a new life.”[15] A considerable portion of this\\ncurious alchemistic work is taken up in expounding the analogy believed\\nto exist between the Philosopher’s Stone and “the Stone which the\\nbuilders rejected,” Christ Jesus; and the writer concludes: “Thus .\\xa0.\\xa0.\\nI have briefly and simply set forth to you the perfect analogy which\\nexists between our earthly and chemical and the true and heavenly Stone,\\nJesus Christ, whereby we may attain unto certain beatitude and\\nperfection, not only in earthly but also in eternal life.”[16] And\\nlikewise says Peter Bonus: “I am firmly persuaded that any unbeliever\\nwho got truly to know this Art, would straightway confess the truth of\\nour Blessed Religion, and believe in the Trinity and in our Lord Jesus\\nChrist.”[17]\\n\\n    [15] _The Sophic Hydrolith; or, Water Stone of the Wise_ (see _The\\n    Hermetic Museum_, vol. i. p. 88).\\n\\n    [16] _Ibid._ p. 114.\\n\\n    [17] PETER BONUS: _The New Pearl of Great Price_ (Mr. A. E. Waite’s\\n    translation, p. 275).\\n\\n\\nThe Dual Nature of Alchemy.\\n\\n§ =11.= For the most part, the alchemists were chiefly engaged with the\\ncarrying out of the alchemistic theory on the physical plane, _i.e._,\\nwith the attempt to transmute the “base” metals into the “noble” ones;\\nsome for the love of knowledge, but alas! the vast majority for the love\\nof mere wealth. But all who were worthy of the title of “alchemist”\\nrealised at times, more or less dimly, the possibility of the\\napplication of the same methods to man and the glorious result of the\\ntransmutation of man’s soul into spiritual gold. There were a few who\\nhad a clearer vision of this ideal, those who devoted their activities\\nentirely, or almost so, to the attainment of this highest goal of\\nalchemistic philosophy, and concerned themselves little if at all with\\nthe analogous problem on the physical plane. The theory that Alchemy\\noriginated in the attempt to demonstrate the applicability of the\\nprinciples of Mysticism to the things of the physical realm brings into\\nharmony the physical and transcendental theories of Alchemy and the\\nvarious conflicting facts advanced in favour of each. It explains the\\nexistence of the above-mentioned, two very different types of\\nalchemists. It explains the appeal to the works attributed to Hermes,\\nand the presence in the writings of the alchemists of much that is\\nclearly mystical. And finally, it is in agreement with such statements\\nas we have quoted above from _The Sophic Hydrolith_ and elsewhere, and\\nthe general religious tone of the alchemistic writings.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 2.\\n\\nSYMBOLICAL ILLUSTRATION\\n\\nRepresenting the Trinity of Body, Soul and Spirit.\\n\\n[_To face page 15_]\\n\\n\\n“Body, Soul and Spirit.”\\n\\n§ =12.= In accordance with our primary object as stated in the preface,\\nwe shall confine our attention mainly to the physical aspect of Alchemy;\\nbut in order to understand its theories, it appears to us to be\\nessential to realise the fact that Alchemy was an attempted application\\nof the principles of Mysticism to the things of the physical world. The\\nsupposed analogy between man and the metals sheds light on what\\notherwise would be very difficult to understand. It helps to make plain\\nwhy the alchemists attributed moral qualities to the metals--some are\\ncalled “imperfect,” “base”; others are said to be “perfect,” “noble.”\\nAnd especially does it help to explain the alchemistic notions\\nregarding the nature of the metals. The alchemists believed that the\\nmetals were constructed after the manner of man, into whose constitution\\nthree factors were regarded as entering: body, soul, and spirit. As\\nregards man, mystical philosophers generally use these terms as follows:\\n“body” is the outward manifestation and form; “soul” is the inward\\nindividual spirit[18]; and “spirit” is the universal Soul in all men.\\nAnd likewise, according to the alchemists, in the metals, there is the\\n“body” or outward form and properties, “metalline soul” or spirit,[19]\\nand finally, the all-pervading essence of all metals. As writes the\\nauthor of the exceedingly curious tract entitled _The Book of\\nLambspring_: “Be warned and understand truly that two fishes are\\nswimming in our sea,” illustrating his remark by the symbolical picture\\nreproduced in plate 2, and adding in elucidation thereof, “The Sea is\\nthe Body, the two Fishes are Soul and Spirit.”[20] The alchemists,\\nhowever, were not always consistent in their use of the term “spirit.”\\nSometimes (indeed frequently) they employed it to denote merely the more\\nvolatile portions of a chemical substance; at other times it had a more\\ninterior significance.\\n\\n    [18] Which, in virtue of man’s self-consciousness, is, by the grace\\n    of God, immortal.\\n\\n    [19] See the work _Of Natural and Supernatural Things_, attributed\\n    to “Basil Valentine,” for a description of the “spirits” of the\\n    metals in particular.\\n\\n    [20] _The Book of Lambspring_, translated by Nicholas Barnaud\\n    Delphinas (see the _Hermetic Museum_, vol. i. p. 277). This work\\n    contains many other fantastic alchemistic symbolical pictures,\\n    amongst the most curious series in alchemistic literature.\\n\\n\\nAlchemy, Mysticism and Modern Science.\\n\\n§ =13.= We notice the great difference between the alchemistic theory\\nand the views regarding the constitution of matter which have dominated\\nChemistry since the time of Dalton. But at the present time Dalton’s\\ntheory of the chemical elements is undergoing a profound modification.\\nWe do not imply that Modern Science is going back to any such fantastic\\nideas as were held by the alchemists, but we are struck with the\\nremarkable similarity between this alchemistic theory of a soul of all\\nmetals, a one primal element, and modern views regarding the ether of\\nspace. In its attempt to demonstrate the applicability of the\\nfundamental principles of Mysticism to the things of the physical realm\\nAlchemy apparently failed and ended its days in fraud. It appears,\\nhowever, that this true aim of alchemistic art--particularly the\\ndemonstration of the validity of the theory that all the various forms\\nof matter are produced by an evolutionary process from some one primal\\nelement or _quintessence_--is being realised by recent researches in the\\ndomain of physical and chemical science.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nTHE THEORY OF PHYSICAL ALCHEMY\\n\\n\\nSupposed Proofs of Transmutation.\\n\\n§ =14.= It must be borne in mind when reviewing the theories of the\\nalchemists, that there were a number of phenomena known at the time, the\\nsuperficial examination of which would naturally engender a belief that\\nthe transmutation of the metals was a common occurrence. For example,\\nthe deposition of copper on iron when immersed in a solution of a copper\\nsalt (_e.g._, blue vitriol) was naturally concluded to be a\\ntransmutation of iron into copper,[21] although, had the alchemists\\nexamined the residual liquid, they would have found that the two metals\\nhad merely exchanged places; and the fact that white and yellow alloys\\nof copper with arsenic and other substances could be produced, pointed\\nto the possibility of transmuting copper into silver and gold. It was\\nalso known that if water (and this is true of distilled water which does\\nnot contain solid matter in solution) was boiled for some time in a\\nglass flask, some solid, earthy matter was produced; and if water could\\nbe transmuted into earth, surely one metal could be converted into\\nanother.[22] On account of these and like phenomena the alchemists\\nregarded the transmutation of the metals as an experimentally proved\\nfact. Even if they are to be blamed for their superficial observation of\\nsuch phenomena, yet, nevertheless, their labours marked a distinct\\nadvance upon the purely speculative and theoretical methods of the\\nphilosophers preceding them. Whatever their faults, the alchemists\\n_were_ the forerunners of modern experimental science.\\n\\n    [21] Cf. _The Golden Tract concerning the Stone of the Philosophers_\\n    (_The Hermetic Museum_, vol. i. p. 25).\\n\\n    [22] Lavoisier (eighteenth century) proved this apparent\\n    transmutation to be due to the action of the water on the glass\\n    vessel containing it.\\n\\n\\nThe Alchemistic Elements.\\n\\n§ =15.= The alchemists regarded the metals as composite, and granting\\nthis, then the possibility of transmutation is only a logical\\nconclusion. In order to understand the theory of the elements held by\\nthem we must rid ourselves of any idea that it bears any close\\nresemblance to Dalton’s theory of the chemical elements; this is clear\\nfrom what has been said in the preceding chapter. Now, it is a fact of\\nsimple observation that many otherwise different bodies manifest some\\nproperty in common, as, for instance, combustibility. Properties such as\\nthese were regarded as being due to some principle or element common to\\nall bodies exhibiting such properties; thus, combustibility was thought\\nto be due to some elementary principle of combustion--the “sulphur” of\\nthe alchemists and the “phlogiston” of a later period. This is a view\\nwhich _à priori_ appears to be not unlikely; but it is now known that,\\nalthough there are relations existing between the properties of bodies\\nand their constituent chemical elements (and also, it should be noted,\\nthe relative arrangement of the particles of these elements), it is the\\nless obvious properties which enable chemists to determine the\\nconstitution of bodies, and the connection is very far from being of the\\nsimple nature imagined by the alchemists.\\n\\n\\nAristotle’s Views regarding the Elements.\\n\\n§ =16.= For the origin of the alchemistic theory of the elements it is\\nnecessary to go back to the philosophers preceding the alchemists, and\\nit is not improbable that they derived it from some still older source.\\nIt was taught by Empedocles of Agrigent (440 B.C. _circa_), who\\nconsidered that there were four elements--earth, water, air, and fire.\\nAristotle added a fifth, “the ether.” These elements were regarded, not\\nas different kinds of matter, but rather as different forms of the one\\noriginal matter, whereby it manifested different properties. It was\\nthought that to these elements were due the four primary properties of\\ndryness, moistness, warmth, and coldness, each element being supposed to\\ngive rise to two of these properties, dryness and warmth being thought\\nto be due to fire, moistness and warmth to air, moistness and coldness\\nto water, and dryness and coldness to earth. Thus, moist and cold bodies\\n(liquids in general) were said to possess these properties in\\nconsequence of the aqueous element, and were termed “waters,” &c. Also,\\nsince these elements were not regarded as different kinds of matter,\\ntransmutation was thought to be possible, one being convertible into\\nanother, as in the example given above (§ 14).\\n\\n\\nThe Sulphur-Mercury Theory.\\n\\n§ =17.= Coming to the alchemists, we find the view that the metals are\\nall composed of two elementary principles--sulphur and mercury--in\\ndifferent proportions and degrees of purity, well-nigh universally\\naccepted in the earlier days of Alchemy. By these terms “sulphur” and\\n“mercury,” however, must not be understood the common bodies ordinarily\\ndesignated by these names; like the elements of Aristotle, the\\nalchemistic principles were regarded as properties rather than as\\nsubstances, though it must be confessed that the alchemists were by no\\nmeans always clear on this point themselves. Indeed, it is not\\naltogether easy to say exactly what the alchemists did mean by these\\nterms, and the question is complicated by the fact that very frequently\\nthey make mention of different sorts of “sulphur” and “mercury.”\\nProbably, however, we shall not be far wrong in saying that “sulphur”\\nwas generally regarded as the principle of combustion and also of\\ncolour, and was said to be present on account of the fact that most\\nmetals are changed into earthy substances by the aid of fire; and to the\\n“mercury,” the metallic principle _par excellence_, was attributed such\\nproperties as fusibility, malleability and lustre, which were regarded\\nas characteristic of the metals in general. The pseudo-Geber (see § 32)\\nsays that “Sulphur is a fatness of the Earth, by temperate Decoction in\\nthe Mine of the Earth thickened, until it be hardned and made dry.”[23]\\nHe considered an excess of sulphur to be a cause of imperfection in the\\nmetals, and he writes that one of the causes of the corruption of the\\nmetals by fire “is the Inclusion of a burning Sulphuriety in the\\nprofundity of their Substance, diminishing them by Inflamation, and\\nexterminating also into Fume, with extream Consumption, whatsoever\\nArgentvive in them is of good Fixation.”[24] He assumed, further, that\\nthe metals contained an incombustible as well as a combustible sulphur,\\nthe latter sulphur being apparently regarded as an impurity.[25] A later\\nalchemist says that sulphur is “most easily recognised by the vital\\nspirit in animals, the colour in metals, the odour in plants.”[26]\\nMercury, on the other hand, according to the pseudo-Geber, is the cause\\nof perfection in the metals, and endows gold with its lustre. Another\\nalchemist, quoting Arnold de Villanova, writes: “Quicksilver is the\\nelementary form of all things fusible; for all things fusible, when\\nmelted, are changed into it, and it mingles with them because it is of\\nthe same substance with them. Such bodies differ from quicksilver in\\ntheir composition only so far as itself is or is not free from the\\nforeign matter of impure sulphur.”[27] The obtaining of “philosophical\\nmercury,” the imaginary virtues of which the alchemists never tired of\\nrelating, was generally held to be essential for the attainment of the\\n_magnum opus_. It was commonly thought that it could be prepared from\\nordinary quicksilver by purificatory processes, whereby the impure\\nsulphur supposed to be present in this sort of mercury might be purged\\naway.\\n\\n    [23] _Of the Sum of Perfection_ (see _The Works of Geber_,\\n    translated by Richard Russel, 1678, pp. 69 and 70).\\n\\n    [24] _Of the Sum of Perfection_ (see _The Works of Geber_, p. 156).\\n\\n    [25] See _The Works of Geber_, p. 160. This view was also held by\\n    other alchemists.\\n\\n    [26] _The New Chemical Light_, Part II., _Concerning Sulphur_ (see\\n    _The Hermetic Museum_, vol. ii. p. 151).\\n\\n    [27] See _The Golden Tract concerning the Stone of the Philosophers_\\n    (_The Hermetic Museum_, vol. i. p. 17).\\n\\nThe sulphur-mercury theory of the metals was held by such famous\\nalchemists as Roger Bacon, Arnold de Villanova and Raymond Lully. Until\\nrecently it was thought to have originated to a great extent with the\\nArabian alchemist, Geber; but the late Professor Berthelot showed that\\nthe works ascribed to Geber, in which the theory is put forward, are\\nforgeries of a date by which it was already centuries old (see § 32).\\nOccasionally, arsenic was regarded as an elementary principle (this view\\nis to be found, for example, in the work _Of the Sum of Perfection_, by\\nthe pseudo-Geber), but the idea was not general.\\n\\n\\nThe Sulphur-Mercury-Salt Theory.\\n\\n§ =18.= Later in the history of Alchemy, the mercury-sulphur theory was\\nextended by the addition of a third elementary principle, salt. As in\\nthe case of philosophical sulphur and mercury, by this term was not\\nmeant common salt (sodium chloride) or any of those substances commonly\\nknown as salts. “Salt” was the name given to a supposed basic principle\\nin the metals, a principle of fixity and solidification, conferring the\\nproperty of resistance to fire. In this extended form, the theory is\\nfound in the works of Isaac of Holland and in those attributed to “Basil\\nValentine,” who (see the work _Of Natural and Supernatural Things_)\\nattempts to explain the differences in the properties of the metals as\\nthe result of the differences in the proportion of sulphur, salt, and\\nmercury they contain. Thus, copper, which is highly coloured, is said to\\ncontain much sulphur, whilst iron is supposed to contain an excess of\\nsalt, &c. The sulphur-mercury-salt theory was vigorously championed by\\nParacelsus, and the doctrine gained very general acceptance amongst the\\nalchemists. Salt, however, seems generally to have been considered a\\nless important principle than either mercury or sulphur.\\n\\nThe same germ-idea underlying these doctrines is to be found much later\\nin Stahl’s phlogistic theory (eighteenth century), which attempted to\\naccount for the combustibility of bodies by the assumption that such\\nbodies all contain “phlogiston”--the hypothetical principle of\\ncombustion (see § 72)--though the concept of “phlogiston” approaches\\nmore nearly to the modern idea of an element than do the alchemistic\\nelements or principles. It was not until still later in the history of\\nChemistry that it became quite evident that the more obvious properties\\nof chemical substances are not specially conferred on them in virtue of\\ncertain elements entering into their constitution.\\n\\n\\nAlchemistic Elements and Principles.\\n\\n§ =19.= The alchemists combined the above theories with Aristotle’s\\ntheory of the elements. The latter, namely, earth, air, fire and water,\\nwere regarded as more interior, more primary, than the principles, whose\\nsource was said to be these same elements. As writes Sendivogius in Part\\nII. of _The New Chemical Light_: “The three Principles of things are\\nproduced out of the four elements in the following manner: Nature, whose\\npower is in her obedience to the Will of God, ordained from the very\\nbeginning, that the four elements should incessantly act on one another\\nso, in obedience to her behest, fire began to act on air, and produced\\nSulphur; air acted on water, and produced Mercury; water, by its action\\non the earth, produced Salt. Earth, alone, having nothing to act upon,\\ndid not produce anything, but became the nurse, or womb, of these three\\nPrinciples. We designedly speak of three Principles; for though the\\nAncients mention only two, it is clear that they omitted the third\\n(Salt) not from ignorance, but from a desire to lead the uninitiated\\nastray.”[28]\\n\\n    [28] _The New Chemical Light_, Part II., _Concerning Sulphur_ (see\\n    _The Hermetic Museum_, vol. ii. pp. 142-143).\\n\\nBeneath and within all these coverings of outward properties, taught the\\nalchemists, is hidden the secret essence of all material things. “.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\nthe elements and compounds,” writes one alchemist, “in addition to crass\\nmatter, are composed of a subtle substance, or intrinsic radical\\nhumidity, diffused through the elemental parts, simple and wholly\\nincorruptible, long preserving the things themselves in vigour, and\\ncalled the Spirit of the World, proceeding from the Soul of the World,\\nthe one certain life, filling and fathoming all things, gathering\\ntogether and connecting all things, so that from the three genera of\\ncreatures, Intellectual, Celestial, and Corruptible, there is formed the\\nOne Machine of the whole world.”[29] It is hardly necessary to point out\\nhow nearly this approaches modern views regarding the Ether of Space.\\n\\n    [29] ALEXANDER VON SUCHTEN: _Man, the best and most perfect of God’s\\n    creatures. A more complete Exposition of this Medical Foundation for\\n    the less Experienced Student._ (See BENEDICTUS FIGULUS: _A Golden\\n    and Blessed Casket of Nature’s Marvels_, translated by A. E. Waite,\\n    1893, pp. 71 and 72.)\\n\\n\\nThe Growth of the Metals.\\n\\n§ =20.= The alchemists regarded the metals as growing in the womb of the\\nearth, and a knowledge of this growth as being of very great importance.\\nThomas Norton (who, however, contrary to the generality of alchemists,\\ndenied that metals have seed and that they grow in the sense of\\nmultiply) says:--\\n\\n    “_Mettalls_ of kinde grow lowe under ground,\\n    For above erth rust in them is found;\\n    Soe above erth appeareth corruption,\\n    Of mettalls, and in long tyme destruction,\\n    Whereof noe Cause is found in this Case,\\n    Buth that above Erth thei be not in their place\\n    Contrarie places to nature causeth strife\\n    As Fishes out of water losen their Lyfe:\\n    And Man, with Beasts, and Birds live in ayer,\\n    But Stones and Mineralls under Erth repaier.”[30]\\n\\n    [30] THOMAS NORTON: _Ordinall of Alchemy_ (see _Theatrum Chemicum\\n    Britannicum_, edited by Elias Ashmole, 1652, p. 18).\\n\\nNorton here expresses the opinion, current among the alchemists, that\\neach and every thing has its own peculiar environment natural to it; a\\nview controverted by Robert Boyle (§ 71). So firm was the belief in the\\ngrowth of metals, that mines were frequently closed for a while in order\\nthat the supply of metal might be renewed. The fertility of Mother Earth\\nforms the subject of one of the illustrations in _The Twelve Keys_ of\\n“Basil Valentine” (see § 41). We reproduce it in plate 3, fig. A.\\nRegarding this subject, the author writes: “The quickening power of the\\nearth produces all things that grow forth from it, and he who says that\\nthe earth has no life makes a statement which is flatly contradicted by\\nthe most ordinary facts. For what is dead cannot produce life and\\ngrowth, seeing that it is devoid of the quickening spirit. This spirit\\nis the life and soul that dwell in the earth, and are nourished by\\nheavenly and sidereal influences. For all herbs, trees, and roots, and\\nall metals and minerals, receive their growth and nutriment from the\\nspirit of the earth, which is the spirit of life. This spirit is itself\\nfed by the stars, and is thereby rendered capable of imparting nutriment\\nto all things that grow, and of nursing them as a mother does her child\\nwhile it is yet in the womb. The minerals are hidden in the womb of the\\nearth, and nourished by her with the spirit which she receives from\\nabove.\\n\\n“Thus the power of growth that I speak of is imparted not by the earth,\\nbut by the life-giving spirit that is in it. If the earth were deserted\\nby this spirit, it would be dead, and no longer able to afford\\nnourishment to anything. For its sulphur or richness would lack the\\nquickening spirit without which there can be neither life nor\\ngrowth.”[31]\\n\\n    [31] “BASIL VALENTINE”: _The Twelve Keys_ (see _The Hermetic\\n    Museum_, vol. i. pp. 333-334).\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 3.\\n\\nA.\\n\\nSYMBOLICAL ILLUSTRATION\\n\\nRepresenting the Fertility of the Earth.\\n\\nB.\\n\\nSYMBOLICAL ILLUSTRATION\\n\\nRepresenting the Amalgamation of Gold with Mercury.\\n\\n(See page 33.)\\n\\n_To face page 26_]]\\n\\n\\nAlchemy and Astrology.\\n\\n§ =21.= The idea that the growth of each metal was under the influence\\nof one of the heavenly bodies (a theory in harmony with the alchemistic\\nview of the unity of the Cosmos), was very generally held by the\\nalchemists; and in consequence thereof, the metals were often referred\\nto by the names or astrological symbols of their peculiar planets. These\\nparticulars are shown in the following table:--\\n\\n  -----------+----------------------+--------------\\n  Metals.    |   Planets, &c.[32]   |   Symbols.\\n  -----------+----------------------+--------------\\n  Gold       |        Sun           |      ☉\\n  Silver     |        Moon          |      ☽\\n  Mercury    |        Mercury       |      ☿\\n  Copper     |        Venus         |      ♀\\n  Iron       |        Mars          |      ♂\\n  Tin        |        Jupiter       |      ♃\\n  Lead       |        Saturn        |      ♄\\n  -----------+----------------------+--------------\\n\\nMoreover, it was thought by some alchemists that a due observance of\\nastrological conditions was necessary for successfully carrying out\\nimportant alchemistic experiments.\\n\\n    [32] This supposed connection between the metals and planets also\\n    played an important part in Talismanic Magic.\\n\\n\\nAlchemistic View of the Nature of Gold.\\n\\n§ =22.= The alchemists regarded gold as the most perfect metal, silver\\nbeing considered more perfect than the rest. The reason of this view is\\nnot difficult to understand: gold is the most beautiful of all the\\nmetals, and it retains its beauty without tarnishing; it resists the\\naction of fire and most corrosive liquids, and is unaffected by sulphur;\\nit was regarded, as we have pointed out above (see § 9), as symbolical\\nof the regenerate man. Silver, on the other hand, is, indeed, a\\nbeautiful metal which wears well in a pure atmosphere and resists the\\naction of fire; but it is attacked by certain corrosives (_e.g._, _aqua\\nfortis_ or nitric acid) and also by sulphur. Through all the metals,\\nfrom the one seed, Nature, according to the alchemists, works\\ncontinuously up to gold; so that, in a sense, all other metals are gold\\nin the making; their existence marks the staying of Nature’s powers; as\\n“Eirenæus Philalethes” says: “All metallic seed is the seed of gold; for\\ngold is the intention of Nature in regard to all metals. If the base\\nmetals are not gold, it is only through some accidental hindrance; they\\nare all potentially gold.”[33] Or, as another alchemist puts it: “Since\\n.\\xa0.\\xa0. the substance of the metals is _one_, and common to all, and since\\nthis substance is (either at once, or after laying aside in course of\\ntime the foreign and evil sulphur of the baser metals by a process of\\ngradual digestion) changed by the virtue of its own indwelling sulphur\\ninto GOLD, which is the goal of all the metals, and the true intention\\nof Nature--we are obliged to admit, and freely confess that in the\\nmineral kingdom, as well as in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, Nature\\nseeks and demands a gradual attainment of perfection, and a gradual\\napproximation to the highest standard of purity and excellence.”[34]\\nSuch was the alchemistic view of the generation of the metals; a theory\\nwhich is admittedly crude, but which, nevertheless, contains the germ of\\na great principle of the utmost importance, namely, the idea that all\\nthe varying forms of matter are evolved from some one primordial\\nstuff--a principle of which chemical science lost sight for awhile, for\\nits validity was unrecognised by Dalton’s Atomic Theory (at least, as\\nenunciated by him), but which is being demonstrated, as we hope to show\\nhereinafter, by recent scientific research. The alchemist was certainly\\na fantastic evolutionist, but he _was_ an evolutionist, and, moreover,\\nhe did not make the curious and paradoxical mistake of regarding the\\nfact of evolution as explaining away the existence of God--the alchemist\\nrecognised the hand of the Divine in nature--and, although, in these\\ndays of modern science, we cannot accept his theory of the growth of\\nmetals, we can, nevertheless, appreciate and accept the fundamental\\ngerm-idea underlying it.\\n\\n    [33] “EIRENÆUS PHILALETHES”: _The Metamorphosis of Metals_ (see _The\\n    Hermetic Museum_, vol. ii. p. 239).\\n\\n    [34] _The Golden Tract Concerning the Stone of the Philosophers_\\n    (see _The Hermetic Museum_, vol. i. p. 19).\\n\\n\\nThe Philosopher’s Stone.\\n\\n§ =23.= The alchemist strove to assist Nature in her gold-making, or, at\\nleast, to carry out her methods. The pseudo-Geber taught that the\\nimperfect metals were to be perfected or cured by the application of\\n“medicines.” Three forms of medicines were distinguished; the first\\nbring about merely a temporary change, and the changes wrought by the\\nsecond class, although permanent, are not complete. “A Medicine of the\\nthird Order,” he writes, “I call every Preparation, which, when it comes\\nto Bodies, with its projection, takes away all Corruption, and perfects\\nthem with the Difference of all Compleatment. But this is one only.”[35]\\nThis, the true medicine that would produce a real and permanent\\ntransmutation, is the =Philosopher’s Stone=, the Masterpiece of\\nalchemistic art. Similar views were held by all the alchemists, though\\nsome of them taught that it was necessary first of all to reduce the\\nmetals to their first substance. Often, two forms of the Philosopher’s\\nStone were distinguished, or perhaps we should say, two degrees of\\nperfection in the one Stone; that for transmuting the “imperfect” metals\\ninto silver being said to be white, the stone or “powder of projection”\\nfor gold being said to be of a red colour. In other accounts (see\\nChapter V.) the medicine is described as of a pale brimstone hue.\\n\\n    [35] _Of the Sum of Perfection_ (see _The Works of Geber_,\\n    translated by Richard Russel, 1678, p. 192).\\n\\nMost of the alchemists who claimed knowledge of the Philosopher’s Stone\\nor the _materia prima_ necessary for its preparation, generally kept its\\nnature most secret, and spoke only in the most enigmatical and\\nallegorical language, the majority of their recipes containing words of\\nunknown meaning. In some cases gold or silver, as the case may be, was\\nemployed in preparing the “medicine”; and, after projection had been\\nmade, this was, of course, obtained again in the metallic form, the\\nalchemist imagining that a transmutation had been effected. In the case\\nof the few other recipes that are intelligible, the most that could be\\nobtained by following out their instructions is a white or yellow\\nmetallic alloy superficially resembling silver or gold.\\n\\n\\nThe Nature of the Philosopher’s Stone.\\n\\n§ =24.= The mystical as distinguished from the pseudo-practical\\ndescriptions of the Stone and its preparation are by far the more\\ninteresting of the two. Paracelsus, in his work on _The Tincture of the\\nPhilosophers_, tells us that all that is necessary for us to do is to\\nmix and coagulate the “rose-coloured blood from the Lion” and “the\\ngluten from the Eagle,” by which he probably meant that we must combine\\n“philosophical sulphur” with “philosophical mercury.” This opinion,\\nthat the Philosopher’s Stone consists of “philosophical sulphur and\\nmercury” combined so as to constitute a perfect unity, was commonly held\\nby the alchemists, and they frequently likened this union to the\\nconjunction of the sexes in marriage. “Eirenæus Philalethes” tells us\\nthat for the preparation of the Stone it is necessary to extract the\\nseed of gold, though this cannot be accomplished by subjecting gold to\\ncorrosive liquids, but only by a homogeneous water (or liquid)--the\\nMercury of the Sages. In the _Book of the Revelation of Hermes,\\ninterpreted by Theophrastus Paracelsus, concerning the Supreme Secret of\\nthe World_, the Medicine, which is here, as not infrequently, identified\\nwith the alchemistic essence of all things or Soul of the World, is\\ndescribed in the following suggestive language: “This is the Spirit of\\nTruth, which the world cannot comprehend without the interposition of\\nthe Holy Ghost, or without the instruction of those who know it. The\\nsame is of a mysterious nature, wondrous strength, boundless power.\\n.\\xa0.\\xa0. By Avicenna this Spirit is named the Soul of the World. For, as\\nthe Soul moves all the limbs of the Body, so also does this Spirit move\\nall bodies. And as the Soul is in all the limbs of the Body, so also is\\nthis Spirit in all elementary created things. It is sought by many and\\nfound by few. It is beheld from afar and found near; for it exists in\\nevery thing, in every place, and at all times. It has the powers of all\\ncreatures; its action is found in all elements, and the qualities of all\\nthings are therein, even in the highest perfection .\\xa0.\\xa0. it heals all\\ndead and living bodies without other medicine, .\\xa0.\\xa0. converts all\\nmetallic bodies into gold, and there is nothing like unto it under\\nHeaven.”[36]\\n\\n    [36] See BENEDICTUS FIGULUS: _A Golden and Blessed Casket of\\n    Nature’s Marvels_ (translated by A. E. Waite, 1893, pp. 36, 37, and\\n    41).\\n\\n\\nThe Theory of Development.\\n\\n§ =25.= From the ascetic standpoint (and unfortunately, most mystics\\nhave been somewhat overfond of ascetic ideas), the development of the\\nsoul is only fully possible with the mortification of the body; and all\\ntrue Mysticism teaches that if we would reach the highest goal possible\\nfor man--union with the Divine--there must be a giving up of our own\\nindividual wills, an abasement of the soul before the Spirit. And so the\\nalchemists taught that for the achievement of the _magnum opus_ on the\\nphysical plane, we must strip the metals of their outward properties in\\norder to develop the essence within. As says Helvetius: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. the\\nessences of metals are hidden in their outward bodies, as the kernel is\\nhidden in the nut. Every earthly body, whether animal, vegetable, or\\nmineral, is the habitation and terrestrial abode of that celestial\\nspirit, or influence, which is its principle of life or growth. The\\nsecret of Alchemy is the destruction of the body, which enables the\\nArtist to get at, and utilise for his own purposes, the living\\nsoul.”[37] This killing of the outward nature of material things was to\\nbe brought about by the processes of putrefaction and decay; hence the\\nreason why such processes figure so largely in alchemistic recipes for\\nthe preparation of the “Divine Magistery.” It must be borne in mind,\\nhowever, that the alchemists used the terms “putrefaction” and “decay”\\nrather indiscriminately, applying them to chemical processes which are\\nno longer regarded as such. Pictorial symbols of death and decay\\nrepresentative of such processes are to be found in several alchemistic\\nbooks. There is a curious series of pictures in _A Form and Method of\\nPerfecting Base Metals_, by Janus Lacinus, the Calabrian (a short tract\\nprefixed to _The New Pearl of Great Price_ by Peter Bonus--see § 39), of\\nwhich we show three examples in plates 3 and 4. In the first picture of\\nthe series (not shown here) we enter the palace of the king (gold) and\\nobserve him sitting crowned upon his throne, surrounded by his son\\n(mercury) and five servants (silver, copper, tin, iron and lead). In the\\nnext picture (plate 3, fig. B), the son, incited by the servants, kills\\nhis father; and, in the third, he catches the blood of his murdered\\nparent in his robes; whereby we understand that an amalgam of gold and\\nmercury is to be prepared, the gold apparently disappearing or dying,\\nwhilst the mercury is coloured thereby. The next picture shows us a\\ngrave being dug, _i.e._, a furnace is to be made ready. In the fifth\\npicture in the series, the son “thought to throw his father into the\\ngrave, and to leave him there; but .\\xa0.\\xa0. both fell in together”; and in\\nthe sixth picture (plate 4, fig. A), we see the son being prevented from\\nescaping, both son and father being left in the grave to decay. Here we\\nhave instructions in symbolical form to place the amalgam in a sealed\\nvessel in the furnace and to allow it to remain there until some change\\nis observed. So the allegory proceeds. Ultimately the father is\\nrestored to life, the symbol of resurrection being (as might be\\nexpected) of frequent occurrence in alchemistic literature. By this\\nresurrection we understand that the gold will finally be obtained in a\\npure form. Indeed, it is now the “great medicine” and, in the last\\npicture of the series (plate 4, fig. B), the king’s son and his five\\nservants are all made kings in virtue of its powers.\\n\\n    [37] J. F. HELVETIUS: _The Golden Calf_, ch. iv.

This claim of the alchemists, that a most minute\\nquantity of the Stone was sufficient to transmute considerable\\nquantities of “base” metal, has been the object of much ridicule.\\nCertainly, some of the claims of the alchemists (understood literally)\\nare out of all reason; but on the other hand, the disproportion between\\nthe quantities of Stone and transmuted metal cannot be advanced as an _à\\npriori_ objection to the alchemists’ claims, inasmuch that a class of\\nchemical reactions (called “catalytic”) is known, in which the presence\\nof a small quantity of some appropriate form of matter--the\\ncatalyst--brings about a chemical change in an indefinite quantity of\\nsome other form or forms; thus, for example, cane-sugar in aqueous\\nsolution is converted into two other sugars by the action of small\\nquantities of acid; and sulphur-dioxide and oxygen, which will not\\ncombine under ordinary conditions, do so readily in the presence of a\\nsmall quantity of platinized asbestos, which is obtained unaltered\\nafter the reaction is completed and may be used over and over again\\n(this process is actually employed in the manufacture of sulphuric acid\\nor oil of vitriol). However, whether any such catalytic transmutation of\\nthe chemical “elements” is possible is merely conjecture.\\n\\n\\nThe Elixir of Life.\\n\\n§ =27.= The Elixir of Life, which was generally described as a solution\\nof the Stone in spirits of wine, or identified with the Stone itself,\\ncould be applied, so it was thought, under certain conditions to the\\nalchemist himself, with an entirely analogous result, _i.e._, it would\\nrestore him to the flower of youth. The idea, not infrequently\\nattributed to the alchemists, that the Elixir would endow one with a\\nlife of endless duration on the material plane is not in strict accord\\nwith alchemistic analogy. From this point of view, the effect of the\\nElixir is physiological perfection, which, although ensuring long life,\\nis not equivalent to endless life on the material plane. “The\\nPhilosophers’ Stone,” says Paracelsus, “purges the whole body of man,\\nand cleanses it from all impurities by the introduction of new and more\\nyouthful forces which it joins to the nature of man.”[38] And in another\\nwork expressive of the opinions of the same alchemist, we read: “.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\nthere is nothing which might deliver the mortal body from death; but\\nthere is One Thing which may postpone decay, renew youth, and prolong\\nshort human life .\\xa0.\\xa0.”[39] In the theory that a solution of the\\nPhilosopher’s Stone (which, it must be remembered, was thought to be of\\na species with gold) constituted the _Elixir Vitæ_, can be traced,\\nperhaps, the idea that gold in a potable form was a veritable cure-all:\\nin the latter days of Alchemy any yellow-coloured liquid was foisted\\nupon a credulous public as a medicinal preparation of gold.\\n\\n    [38] THEOPHRASTUS PARACELSUS: _The Fifth Book of the Archidoxies_\\n    (see _The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus_,\\n    translated by A. E. Waite, 1894, vol. ii. p. 39).\\n\\n    [39] _The Book of the Revelation of Hermes, interpreted by\\n    Theophrastus Paracelsus, concerning the Supreme Secret of the\\n    World._ (See BENEDICTUS FIGULUS: _A Golden Casket of Nature’s\\n    Marvels_, translated by A.

A and B.--Two forms of Apparatus for Sublimation.\\n\\n_To face page 37_]]\\n\\n\\nThe Practical Methods of the Alchemists.\\n\\n§ =28.= We will conclude this chapter with some few remarks regarding\\nthe practical methods of the alchemists. In their experiments, the\\nalchemists worked with very large quantities of material compared with\\nwhat is employed in chemical researches at the present day. They had\\ngreat belief in the efficacy of time to effect a desired change in their\\nsubstances, and they were wont to repeat the same operation (such as\\ndistillation, for example) on the same material over and over again;\\nwhich demonstrated their unwearied patience, even if it effected little\\ntowards the attainment of their end. They paid much attention to any\\nchanges of colour they observed in their experiments, and many\\ndescriptions of supposed methods to achieve the _magnum opus_ contain\\ndetailed directions as to the various changes of colour which must be\\nobtained in the material operated upon if a successful issue to the\\nexperiment is desired.[40] In plates 5 and 6 we give illustrations of\\nsome characteristic pieces of apparatus employed by the alchemists.\\nPlate 5, fig. A, and plate 6, fig. A, are from a work known as\\n_Alchemiae Gebri_ (1545); plate 5, fig. B, is from Glauber’s work on\\nFurnaces (1651); and plate 6, fig. B, is from a work by Dr. John French\\nentitled _The Art of Distillation_ (1651). The first figure shows us a\\nfurnace and alembics. The alembic proper is a sort of still-head which\\ncan be luted on to a flask or other vessel, and was much used for\\ndistillations. In the present case, however, the alembics are employed\\nin conjunction with apparatus for subliming difficultly volatile\\nsubstances. Plate 5, fig. B, shows another apparatus for sublimation,\\nconsisting of a sort of oven, and three detachable upper chambers,\\ngenerally called aludels. In both forms of apparatus the vapours are\\ncooled in the upper part of the vessel, and the substance is deposited\\nin the solid form, being thereby purified from less volatile impurities.\\nPlate 6, fig. A, shows an athanor (or digesting furnace) and a couple of\\ndigesting vessels. A vessel of this sort was employed for heating bodies\\nin a closed space, the top being sealed up when the substances to be\\noperated upon had been put inside, and the vessel heated in ashes in an\\nathanor, a uniform temperature being maintained. The pelican,\\nillustrated in plate 6, fig. B, was used for a similar purpose, the two\\narms being added in the idea that the vapours would be circulated\\nthereby.\\n\\n    [40] As writes Espagnet in his _Hermetic Arcanum_, canons 64 and 65:\\n    “The Means or demonstrative signs are Colours, successively and\\n    orderly affecting the matter and its affections and demonstrative\\n    passions, whereof there are also three special ones (as critical) to\\n    be noted; to these some add a Fourth. The first is black, which is\\n    called the Crow’s head, because of its extreme blackness, whose\\n    crepusculum sheweth the beginning of the action of the fire of\\n    nature and solution, and the blackest midnight sheweth the\\n    perfection of liquefaction, and confusion of the elements. Then the\\n    grain putrefies and is corrupted, that it may be the more apt for\\n    generation. The white colour succeedeth the black, wherein is given\\n    the perfection of the first degree, and of the White Sulphur. This\\n    is called the blessed stone; this Earth is white and foliated,\\n    wherein Philosophers do sow their gold. The third is Orange colour,\\n    which is produced in the passage of the white to the red, as the\\n    middle, and being mixed of both is as the dawn with his saffron\\n    hair, a forerunner of the Sun. The fourth colour is Ruddy and\\n    Sanguine, which is extracted from the white fire only. Now because\\n    whiteness is easily altered by any other colour before day it\\n    quickly faileth of its candour. But the deep redness of the Sun\\n    perfecteth the work of Sulphur, which is called the Sperm of the\\n    male, the fire of the Stone, the King’s Crown, and the Son of Sol,\\n    wherein the first labour of the workman resteth.\\n\\n    “Besides these decretory signs which firmly inhere in the matter,\\n    and shew its essential mutations, almost infinite colours appear,\\n    and shew themselves in vapours, as the Rainbow in the clouds, which\\n    quickly pass away and are expelled by those that succeed, more\\n    affecting the air than the earth: the operator must have a gentle\\n    care of them, because they are not permanent, and proceed not from\\n    the intrinsic disposition of the matter, but from the fire painting\\n    and fashioning everything after its pleasure, or casually by heat in\\n    slight moisture” (see _Collectanea Hermetica_, edited by W. Wynn\\n    Westcott, vol. i., 1893, pp. 28 and 29). Very probably this is not\\n    without a mystical meaning as well as a supposed application in the\\n    preparation of the physical Stone.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 6.\\n\\nALCHEMISTIC APPARATUS. A.--An Athanor. B.--A Pelican.\\n\\n_To face page 38_]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nTHE ALCHEMISTS[41]\\n\\n(A. BEFORE PARACELSUS)\\n\\n\\nHermes Trismegistos.\\n\\n§ =29.= Having now considered the chief points in the theory of Physical\\nAlchemy, we must turn our attention to the lives and individual\\nteachings of the alchemists themselves. The first name which is found in\\nthe history of Alchemy is that of =Hermes Trismegistos=. We have already\\nmentioned the high esteem in which the works ascribed to this personage\\nwere held by the alchemists (§ 6). He has been regarded as the father of\\nAlchemy; his name has supplied a synonym for the Art--the Hermetic\\nArt--and even to-day we speak of _hermetically_ sealing flasks and the\\nlike. But who Hermes actually was, or even if there were such a\\npersonage, is a matter of conjecture. The alchemists themselves supposed\\nhim to have been an Egyptian living about the time of Moses. He is now\\ngenerally regarded as purely mythical--a personification of Thoth, the\\nEgyptian God of learning; but, of course, some person or persons must\\nhave written the works attributed to him, and the first of such writers\\n(if, as seems not unlikely, there were more than one) may be considered\\nto have a right to the name. Of these works, the _Divine Pymander_,[42]\\na mystical-religious treatise, is the most important. The _Golden\\nTractate_, also attributed to Hermes, which is an exceedingly obscure\\nalchemistic work, is now regarded as having been written at a\\ncomparatively late date.\\n\\n    [41] It is perhaps advisable to mention here that the lives of the\\n    alchemists, for the most part, are enveloped in considerable\\n    obscurity, and many points in connection therewith are in dispute.\\n    The authorities we have followed will be found, as a rule,\\n    specifically mentioned in what follows; but we may here acknowledge\\n    our general indebtedness to the following works, though, as the\\n    reader will observe, many others have been consulted as well: Thomas\\n    Thomson’s _The History of Chemistry_, Meyer’s _A History of\\n    Chemistry_, the anonymous _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_\\n    (1815), the works of Mr. A. E. Waite, the _Dictionary of National\\n    Biography_, and certain articles in the _Encyclopædia Britannica_.\\n    This must not be taken to mean, however, that we have always\\n    followed the conclusions reached in these works, for so far as the\\n    older of them are concerned, recent researches by various\\n    authorities--to whom reference will be found in the following pages,\\n    and to whom, also, we are indebted--have shown, in certain cases,\\n    that such are not tenable.\\n\\n    [42] Dr. Everard’s translation of this work forms vol. ii. of the\\n    _Collectanea Hermetica_, edited by W. Wynn Westcott, M.B., D.P.H. It\\n    is now, however, out of print.\\n\\n\\nThe Smaragdine Table.\\n\\n§ =30.= In a work attributed to Albertus Magnus, but which is probably\\nspurious, we are told that Alexander the Great found the tomb of Hermes\\nin a cave near Hebron. This tomb contained an emerald table--“The\\nSmaragdine Table”--on which were inscribed the following thirteen\\nsentences in Phœnician characters:--\\n\\n1. I speak not fictitious things, but what is true and most certain.\\n\\n2. What is below is like that which is above, and what is above is like\\nthat which is below, to accomplish the miracles of one thing.\\n\\n3. And as all things were produced by the mediation of one Being, so all\\nthings were produced from this one thing by adaptation.\\n\\n4. Its father is the Sun, its mother the Moon; the wind carries it in\\nits belly, its nurse is the earth.\\n\\n5. It is the cause of all perfection throughout the whole world.\\n\\n6. Its power is perfect if it be changed into earth.\\n\\n7. Separate the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross, acting\\nprudently and with judgment.\\n\\n8. Ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven, and then\\nagain descend to the earth, and unite together the powers of things\\nsuperior and things inferior. Thus you will obtain the glory of the\\nwhole world, and all obscurity will fly far away from you.\\n\\n9. This thing is the fortitude of all fortitude, because it overcomes\\nall subtle things, and penetrates every solid thing.\\n\\n10. Thus were all things created.\\n\\n11. Thence proceed wonderful adaptations which are produced in this way.\\n\\n12. Therefore am I called Hermes Trismegistos, possessing the three\\nparts of the philosophy of the whole world.\\n\\n13. That which I had to say concerning the operation of the Sun is\\ncompleted.\\n\\nThese sentences clearly teach the doctrine of the alchemistic essence or\\n“One Thing,” which is everywhere present, penetrating even solids (this\\nwe should note is true of the ether of space), and out of which all\\nthings of the physical world are made by adaptation or modification. The\\nterms Sun and Moon in the above passage probably stand for Spirit and\\nMatter respectively, not gold and silver.\\n\\n\\nZosimus of Panopolis.\\n\\n§ =31.= One of the earliest of the alchemists of whom record remains was\\n=Zosimus of Panopolis=, who flourished in the fifth century, and was\\nregarded by the later alchemists as a master of the Art. He is said to\\nhave written many treatises dealing with Alchemy, but only fragments\\nremain. Of these fragments, Professor Venable says: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. they give us\\na good idea of the learning of the man and of his times. They contain\\ndescriptions of apparatus, of furnaces, studies of minerals, of alloys,\\nof glass making, of mineral waters, and much that is mystical, besides a\\ngood deal referring to the transmutation of metals.”[43] Zosimus is said\\nto have been the author of the saying, “like begets like,” but whether\\nall the fragments ascribed to him were really his work is doubtful.\\n\\n    [43] F. P. VENABLE, Ph.D.: _A Short History of Chemistry_ (1896), p.\\n    13.\\n\\nAmong other early alchemists we may mention also =Africanus=, the\\nSyrian; =Synesius=, Bishop of Ptolemais, and the historian,\\n=Olympiodorus= of Thebes.\\n\\n\\nGeber.\\n\\n§ =32.= In the seventh century the Arabians conquered Egypt; and\\nstrangely enough, Alchemy flourished under them to a remarkable degree.\\nOf all the Arabian alchemists, =Geber= has been regarded as the\\ngreatest; as Professor Meyer says: “There can be no dispute that with\\nthe name _Geber_ was propagated the memory of a personality with which\\nthe chemical knowledge of the time was bound up.”[44] Geber is supposed\\nto have lived about the ninth century, but of his life nothing definite\\nis known. A large number of works have been ascribed to him, of which\\nthe majority are unknown, but the four Latin MSS. which have been\\nprinted under the titles _Summa Perfectionis Mettalorum_, _De\\nInvestigatione Perfectionis Metallorum_, _De Inventione Veritatis_ and\\n_De Fornacibus Construendis_, were, until a few years ago, regarded as\\ngenuine. On the strength of these works, Geber has ranked high as a\\nchemist. In them are described the preparation of many important\\nchemical compounds; the most essential chemical operations, such as\\nsublimation, distillation, filtration, crystallisation (or coagulation,\\nas the alchemists called it), &c.; and also important chemical\\napparatus, for example, the water-bath, improved furnaces, &c. However,\\nit was shown by the late Professor Berthelot that _Summa Perfectionis\\nMettalorum_ is a forgery of the fourteenth century, and the other works\\nforgeries of an even later date. Moreover, the original Arabic MSS. of\\nGeber have been brought to light. These true writings of Geber are very\\nobscure; they give no warrant for believing that the famous\\nsulphur-mercury theory was due to this alchemist, and they prove him not\\nto be the expert chemist that he was supposed to have been. The spurious\\nwritings mentioned above show that the pseudo-Geber was a man of wide\\nchemical knowledge and experience, and play a not inconsiderable part in\\nthe history of Alchemy.\\n\\n    [44] ERNST VON MEYER: _A History of Chemistry_ (translated by Dr.\\n    McGowan, 1906), p. 31.\\n\\n\\nOther Arabian Alchemists.\\n\\n§ =33.= Among other Arabian alchemists the most celebrated were\\n=Avicenna= and =Rhasis=, who are supposed to have lived some time after\\nGeber; and to whom, perhaps, the sulphur-mercury theory may have been to\\nsome extent due.\\n\\nThe teachings of the Arabian alchemists gradually penetrated into the\\nWestern world, in which, during the thirteenth century, flourished some\\nof the most eminent of the alchemists, whose lives and teachings we must\\nnow briefly consider.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 7.\\n\\n[by de Bry]\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF ALBERTUS MAGNUS.\\n\\n_To face page 44_]]\\n\\n\\nAlbertus Magnus (1193-1280).\\n\\n§ =34.= =Albertus Magnus=, Albert Groot or Albert von Bollstädt (see\\nplate 7), was born at Lauingen, probably in 1193. He was educated at\\nPadua, and in his later years he showed himself apt at acquiring the\\nknowledge of his time. He studied theology, philosophy and natural\\nscience, and is chiefly celebrated as an Aristotelean philosopher. He\\nentered the Dominican order, taught publicly at Cologne, Paris and\\nelsewhere, and was made provincial of this order. Later he had the\\nbishopric of Regensburg conferred on him, but he retired after a few\\nyears to a Dominican cloister, where he devoted himself to philosophy\\nand science. He was one of the most learned men of his time and,\\nmoreover, a man of noble character. The authenticity of the alchemistic\\nworks attributed to him has been questioned.\\n\\n\\nThomas Aquinas (1225-1274).\\n\\n§ =35.= The celebrated Dominican, =Thomas Aquinas= (see plate 8), was\\nprobably a pupil of Albertus Magnus, from whom it is thought he imbibed\\nalchemistic learning. It is very probable, however, that the alchemistic\\nworks attributed to him are spurious. The author of these works\\nmanifests a deeply religious tone, and, according to Thomson’s _History\\nof Chemistry_, he was the first to employ the term “amalgam” to\\ndesignate an alloy of mercury with some other metal.[45]\\n\\n    [45] THOMAS THOMSON: _The History of Chemistry_, vol. i. (1830), p.\\n    33.\\n\\n\\nRoger Bacon (1214-1294).\\n\\n§ =36.= =Roger Bacon=, the most illustrious of the mediæval alchemists,\\nwas born near Ilchester in Somerset, probably in 1214. His erudition,\\nconsidering the general state of ignorance prevailing at this time, was\\nmost remarkable. Professor Meyer says: “He is to be regarded as the\\nintellectual originator of experimental research, if the departure in\\nthis direction is to be coupled with any one name--a direction which,\\nfollowed more and more as time went on, gave to the science [of\\nChemistry] its own peculiar stamp, and ensured its steady\\ndevelopment.”[46] Roger Bacon studied theology and science at Oxford and\\nat Paris; and he joined the Franciscan order, at what date, however, is\\nuncertain. He was particularly interested in optics, and certain\\ndiscoveries in this branch of physics have been attributed to him,\\nthough probably erroneously. It appears, also, that he was acquainted\\nwith gunpowder, which was, however, not employed in Europe until many\\nyears later.[47] Unfortunately, he earned the undesirable reputation of\\nbeing in communication with the powers of darkness, and as he did not\\nhesitate to oppose many of the opinions current at the time, he\\nsuffered much persecution. He was a firm believer in the powers of the\\nPhilosopher’s Stone to transmute large quantities of “base” metal into\\ngold, and also to extend the life of the individual. “_Alchimy_,” he\\nsays, “is a Science, teaching how to transforme any kind of mettall into\\nanother: and that by a proper medicine, as it appeareth by many\\nPhilosophers Bookes. _Alchimy_ therefore is a science teaching how to\\nmake and compound a certaine medicine, which is called _Elixir_, the\\nwhich when it is cast upon mettals or imperfect bodies, doth fully\\nperfect them in the verie projection.”[48] He also believed in\\nAstrology; but, nevertheless, he was entirely opposed to many of the\\nmagical and superstitious notions held at the time, and his tract, _De\\nSecretis Operibus Artis et Naturæ, et de Nullitate Magiæ_, was an\\nendeavour to prove that many so-called “miracles” could be brought about\\nsimply by the aid of natural science. Roger Bacon was a firm supporter\\nof the Sulphur-Mercury theory: he says: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. the natural principles in\\nthe mynes, are _Argent-vive_, and _Sulphur_. All mettals and minerals,\\nwhereof there be sundrie and divers kinds, are begotten of these two:\\nbut I must tel you, that nature alwaies intendeth and striveth to the\\nperfection of Gold: but many accidents coming between, change the\\nmetalls. .\\xa0.\\xa0. For according to the puritie and impuritie of the two\\naforesaide principles, _Argent-vive_ and _Sulphur_, pure, and impure\\nmettals are ingendred.”[49] He expresses surprise that any should employ\\nanimal and vegetable substances in their attempts to prepare the Stone,\\na practice common to some alchemists but warmly criticised by others.\\nHe says: “Nothing may be mingled with mettalls which hath not beene made\\nor sprung from them, it remaineth cleane inough, that no strange thing\\nwhich hath not his originall from these two [viz., sulphur and mercury],\\nis able to perfect them, or to make a chaunge and new transmutation of\\nthem: so that it is to be wondered at, that any wise man should set his\\nmind upon living creatures, or vegetables which are far off, when there\\nbe minerals to bee found nigh enough: neither may we in any wise thinke,\\nthat any of the Philosophers placed the Art in the said remote things,\\nexcept it were by way of comparison.”[50] The one process necessary for\\nthe preparation of the Stone, he tells us, is “continuall concoction” in\\nthe fire, which is the method that “God hath given to nature.”[51] He\\ndied about 1294.\\n\\n    [46] ERNST VON MEYER: _A History of Chemistry_ (translated by Dr.\\n    McGowan, 1906), p. 35.\\n\\n    [47] See ROGER BACON’S _Discovery of Miracles_, chaps. vi. and xi.\\n\\n    [48] ROGER BACON: _The Mirror of Alchimy_ (1597), p. 1.\\n\\n    [49] _Ibid._ p. 2.\\n\\n    [50] ROGER BACON: _The Mirror of Alchimy_ (1597), p. 4.\\n\\n    [51] _Ibid._ p. 9.\\n\\n\\nArnold de Villanova (12--?-1310?).\\n\\n§ =37.= The date and birthplace of =Arnold de Villanova=, or Villeneuve,\\nare both uncertain.

To\\navoid persecution at the hands of the Inquisition, he was obliged to\\nleave Spain, and ultimately found safety with Frederick II. in Sicily.\\nHe was famous not only as an alchemist, but also as a skilful physician.\\nHe died (it is thought in a shipwreck) about 1310-1313.\\n\\n\\nRaymond Lully (1235?-1315).\\n\\n§ =38.= =Raymond Lully=, the son of a noble Spanish family, was born at\\nPalma (in Majorca) about 1235. He was a man of somewhat eccentric\\ncharacter--in his youth a man of pleasure; in his maturity, a mystic\\nand ascetic. His career was of a roving and adventurous character. We\\nare told that, in his younger days, although married, he became\\nviolently infatuated with a lady of the name of Ambrosia de Castello,\\nwho vainly tried to dissuade him from his profane passion. Her efforts\\nproving futile, she requested Lully to call upon her, and in the\\npresence of her husband, bared to his sight her breast, which was almost\\neaten away by a cancer. This sight--so the story goes--brought about\\nLully’s conversion. He became actuated by the idea of converting to\\nChristianity the heathen in Africa, and engaged the services of an\\nArabian whereby he might learn the language. The man, however,\\ndiscovering his master’s object, attempted to assassinate him, and Lully\\nnarrowly escaped with his life. But his enthusiasm for missionary work\\nnever abated--his central idea was the reasonableness and\\ndemonstrability of Christian doctrine--and unhappily he was, at last,\\nstoned to death by the inhabitants of Bugiah (in Algeria) in 1315.[52]\\n\\n    [52] See _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_ (1815), pp. 17 _et\\n    seq._\\n\\nA very large number of alchemistic, theological and other treatises are\\nattributed to Lully, many of which are undoubtedly spurious; and it is a\\ndifficult question to decide exactly which are genuine. He is supposed\\nto have derived a knowledge of Alchemy from Roger Bacon and Arnold de\\nVillanova. It appears more probable, however, either that Lully the\\nalchemist was a personage distinct from the Lully whose life we have\\nsketched above, or that the alchemistic writings attributed to him are\\nforgeries of a similar nature to the works of pseudo-Geber (§ 32). Of\\nthese alchemical writings we may here mention the _Clavicula_. This he\\nsays is the key to all his other books on Alchemy, in which books the\\nwhole Art is fully declared, though so obscurely as not to be\\nunderstandable without its aid. In this work an alleged method for what\\nmay be called the multiplication of the “noble” metals rather than\\ntransmutation is described in clear language; but it should be noticed\\nthat the stone employed is itself a compound either of silver or gold.\\nAccording to Lully, the secret of the Philosopher’s Stone is the\\nextraction of the mercury of silver or gold. He writes: “Metals cannot\\nbe transmuted .\\xa0.\\xa0. in the Minerals, unless they be reduced into their\\nfirst Matter. .\\xa0.\\xa0. Therefore I counsel you, O my Friends, that you do\\nnot work but about _Sol_ and _Luna_, reducing them into the first\\nMatter, our _Sulphur_ and _Argent vive_: therefore, Son, you are to use\\nthis venerable Matter; and I swear unto you and promise, that unless you\\ntake the _Argent vive_ of these two, you go to the Practick as blind men\\nwithout eyes or sense. .\\xa0.\\xa0.”[53]\\n\\n    [53] RAYMOND LULLY: _Clavicula, or, A Little Key_ (see _Aurifontina\\n    Chymica_, 1680, p. 167).\\n\\n\\nPeter Bonus (14th Century).\\n\\n§ =39.= In 1546, a work was published entitled _Magarita Pretiosa_,\\nwhich claimed to be a “faithful abridgement,” by “Janus Lacinus\\nTherapus, the Calabrian,” of a MS. written by =Peter Bonus= in the\\nfourteenth century. An abridged English translation of this book by Mr.\\nA. E. Waite was published in 1894. Of the life of Bonus, who is said to\\nhave been an inhabitant of Pola, a seaport of Istria, nothing is known;\\nbut the _Magarita Pretiosa_ is an alchemistic work of considerable\\ninterest. The author commences, like pseudo-Geber in his _Sum of\\nPerfection_, by bringing forward a number of very ingenious arguments\\nagainst the validity of the Art; he then proceeds with arguments in\\nfavour of Alchemy and puts forward answers in full to the former\\nobjections; further difficulties, &c., are then dealt with. In all this,\\ncompared with many other alchemists, Bonus, though somewhat prolix, is\\nremarkably lucid. All metals, he argues, following the views of\\npseudo-Geber, consist of mercury and sulphur; but whilst the mercury is\\nalways one and the same, different metals contain different sulphurs.\\nThere are also two different kinds of sulphurs--inward and outward.\\nSulphur is necessary for the development of the mercury, but for the\\nfinal product, gold, to come forth, it is necessary that the outward and\\nimpure sulphur be purged off. “Each metal,” says Bonus, “differs from\\nall the rest, and has a certain perfection and completeness of its own;\\nbut none, except gold, has reached that highest degree of perfection of\\nwhich it is capable. For all common metals there is a transient and a\\nperfect state of inward completeness, and this perfect state they attain\\neither through the slow operation of Nature, or through the sudden\\ntransformatory power of our Stone. We must, however, add that the\\nimperfect metals form part of the great plan and design of Nature,\\nthough they are in course of transformation into gold. For a large\\nnumber of very useful and indispensable tools and utensils could not be\\nprovided at all if there were no copper, iron, tin, or lead, and if all\\nmetals were either silver or gold. For this beneficent reason Nature\\nhas furnished us with the metallic substance in all its different stages\\nof development, from iron, or the lowest, to gold, or the highest state\\nof metallic perfection. Nature is ever studying variety, and, for that\\nreason, instead of covering the whole face of the earth with water, has\\nevolved out of that elementary substance a great diversity of forms,\\nembracing the whole animal, vegetable and mineral world. It is, in like\\nmanner, for the use of men that Nature has differentiated the metallic\\nsubstance into a great variety of species and forms.”[54] According to\\nthis interesting alchemistic work, the Art of Alchemy consists, not in\\nreducing the imperfect metals to their first substance, but in carrying\\nforward Nature’s work, developing the imperfect metals to perfection and\\nremoving their impure sulphur.\\n\\n    [54] PETER BONUS: _The New Pearl of Great Price_ (Mr. A. E. Waite’s\\n    translation, pp. 176-177).\\n\\n\\nNicolas Flamel (1330-1418).\\n\\n§ =40.= Nicolas Flamel (see plate 8) was born about 1330, probably in\\nParis. His parents were poor, and Nicolas took up the trade of a\\nscrivener. In the course of time, Flamel became a very wealthy man and,\\nat the same time, it appears, one who exhibited considerable\\nmunificence. This increase in Flamel’s wealth has been attributed to\\nsupposed success in the Hermetic Art. We are told that a remarkable book\\ncame into the young scrivener’s possession, which, at first, he was\\nunable to understand, until, at last, he had the good fortune to meet an\\nadept who translated its mysteries for him. This book revealed the\\noccult secrets of Alchemy, and by its means Nicolas was enabled to\\nobtain immense quantities of gold. This story, however, appears to be of\\na legendary nature, and it seems more likely that Flamel’s riches\\nresulted from his business as a scrivener and from moneylending. At any\\nrate, all of the alchemistic works attributed to Flamel are of more or\\nless questionable origin. One of these, entitled _A Short Tract, or\\nPhilosophical Summary_, will be found in _The Hermetic Museum_. It is a\\nvery brief work, supporting the sulphur-mercury theory.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 8.\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF THOMAS AQUINAS.\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF NICOLAS FLAMEL.\\n\\n_To face page 52_]]\\n\\n\\n“Basil Valentine” and “The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony.”\\n\\n§ =41.= Probably the most celebrated of all alchemistic books is the\\nwork known as _Triumph-Wagen des Antimonii_. A Latin translation with a\\ncommentary by Theodore Kerckringius was published in 1685, and an\\nEnglish translation of this version by Mr. A. E. Waite appeared in 1893.\\nThe author describes himself as “=Basil Valentine=, a Benedictine monk.”\\nIn his “_Practica_,” another alchemistic work, he says: “When I had\\nemptied to the dregs the cup of human suffering, I was led to consider\\nthe wretchedness of this world, and the fearful consequences of our\\nfirst parents’ disobedience .\\xa0.\\xa0. I made haste to withdraw myself from\\nthe evil world, to bid farewell to it, and to devote myself to the\\nService of God.”[55] He proceeds to relate that he entered a monastery,\\nbut finding that he had some time on his hands after performing his\\ndaily work and devotions, and not wishing to pass this time in idleness,\\nhe took up the study of Alchemy, “the investigation of those natural\\nsecrets by which God has shadowed out eternal things,” and at last\\nhis labours were rewarded by the discovery of a Stone most potent in the\\ncuring of diseases. In _The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony_ are\\naccurately described a large number of antimonial preparations, and as\\nBasil was supposed to have written this work some time in the fifteenth\\ncentury, these preparations were accordingly concluded to have been, for\\nthe most part, his own discoveries. He defends with the utmost vigour\\nthe medicinal values of antimony, and criticises in terms far from mild\\nthe physicians of his day. On account of this work Basil Valentine has\\nranked very high as an experimental chemist; but from quite early times\\nits date and authorship have been regarded alike as doubtful; and it\\nappears from the researches of the late Professor Schorlemmer “to be an\\nundoubted forgery dating from about 1600, the information being culled\\nfrom the works of other writers. .\\xa0.\\xa0.”[56] Probably the other works\\nascribed to Basil Valentine are of a like nature. _The Triumphal Chariot\\nof Antimony_ does, however, give an accurate account of the knowledge of\\nantimony of this time, and the pseudo-Valentine shows himself to have\\nbeen a man of considerable experience with regard to this subject.\\n\\n    [55] “BASIL VALENTINE”: _The “Practica”_ (see _The Hermetic Museum_,\\n    vol. i. p. 313).\\n\\n    [56] Sir H.

They are supposed\\nto have lived during the fifteenth century, but of their lives nothing\\nis known. Isaac, although not free from superstitious opinions, appears\\nto have been a practical chemist, and his works, which abound in\\nrecipes, were held in great esteem by Paracelsus and other alchemists.\\nHe held that all things in this world are of a dual nature, partly good\\nand partly bad. “.\\xa0.\\xa0. All that God hath created good in the upper part\\nof the world,” he writes, “are perfect and uncorruptible, as the heaven:\\nbut whatsoever in these lower parts, whether it be in beasts, fishes,\\nand all manner of sensible creatures, hearbs or plants, it is indued\\nwith a double nature, that is to say, perfect, and unperfect; the\\nperfect nature is called the Quintessence, the unperfect the Feces or\\ndreggs, or the venemous or combustible oile. .\\xa0.\\xa0. God hath put a secret\\nnature or influence in every creature, and .\\xa0.\\xa0. to every nature of one\\nsort or kind he hath given one common influence and vertue, whether it\\nbee on Physick or other secret works, which partly are found out by\\nnaturall workmanship. And yet more things are unknown than are apparent\\nto our senses.”[57] He gives directions for extracting the Quintessence,\\nfor which marvellous powers are claimed, out of sugar and other organic\\nsubstances; and he appears to be the earliest known writer who makes\\nmention of the famous sulphur-mercury-salt theory.\\n\\n    [57] _One hundred and Fourteen Experiments and Cures of the Famous\\n    Physitian Theophrastus Paracelsus, whereunto is added .\\xa0.\\xa0. certain\\n    Secrets of Isaac Hollandus, concerning the Vegetall and Animall\\n    Work_ (1652), p. 35.\\n\\n\\nBernard Trévisan (1406-1490).\\n\\n§ =43.= =Bernard Trévisan=, a French count of the fifteenth century,\\nsquandered enormous sums of money in the search for the Stone, in which\\nthe whole of his life and energies were engaged. He seems to have become\\nthe dupe of one charlatan after another, but at last, at a ripe old\\nage, he says that his labours were rewarded, and that he successfully\\nperformed the _magnum opus_. In a short, but rather obscure work, he\\nspeaks of the Philosopher’s Stone in the following words: “This Stone\\nthen is compounded of a Body and Spirit, or of a volatile and fixed\\nSubstance, and that is therefore done, because nothing in the World can\\nbe generated and brought to light without these two Substances, to wit,\\na Male and Female: From whence it appeareth, that although these two\\nSubstances are not of one and the same species, yet one Stone doth\\nthence arise, and although they appear and are said to be two\\nSubstances, yet in truth it is but one, to wit, _Argent-vive_.”[58] He\\nappears, however, to have added nothing to our knowledge of chemical\\nscience.\\n\\n    [58] BERNARD, EARL OF TRÉVISAN: _A Treatise of the Philosophers\\n    Stone_, 1683 (see _Collectanea Chymica: A Collection of Ten Several\\n    Treatises in Chemistry_, 1684, p. 91).\\n\\n\\nSir George Ripley (14--?-1490?).\\n\\n§ =44.= =Sir George Ripley=, an eminent alchemistic philosopher of the\\nfifteenth century, entered upon a monastic life when a youth, becoming\\none of the canons regular of Bridlington. After some travels he returned\\nto England and obtaining leave from the Pope to live in solitude, he\\ndevoted himself to the study of the Hermetic Art. His chief work is _The\\nCompound of Alchymie .\\xa0.\\xa0. conteining twelve Gates_, which was written\\nin 1471. In this curious work, we learn that there are twelve processes\\nnecessary for the achievement of the _magnum opus_, namely, Calcination,\\nSolution, Separation, Conjunction, Putrefaction, Congelation, Cibation,\\nSublimation, Fermentation, Exaltation, Multiplication, and Projection.\\nThese are likened to the twelve gates of a castle which the philosopher\\nmust enter. At the conclusion of the twelfth gate, Ripley says:--\\n\\n      “Now thou hast conqueryd the _twelve Gates_,\\n    And all the Castell thou holdyst at wyll,\\n    Keep thy Secretts in store unto thy selve;\\n    And the commaundements of God looke thou fulfull:\\n    In fyer conteinue thy glas styll,\\n      And Multeply thy Medcyns ay more and more,\\n      For wyse men done say _store ys no sore_.”[59]\\n\\n    [59] Sir GEORGE RIPLEY: _The Compound of Alchemy_ (see _Theatrum\\n    Chemicum Britannicum_, edited by Elias Ashmole, 1652, p. 186).\\n\\nAt the conclusion of the work he tells us that in all that he wrote\\nbefore he was mistaken; he says:--\\n\\n      “I made _Solucyons_ full many a one,\\n    Of Spyrytts, Ferments, Salts, Yerne and Steele;\\n    Wenyng so to make the Phylosophers Stone:\\n    But fynally I lost eche dele,\\n    After my Boks yet wrought I well;\\n      Whych evermore untrue I provyd,\\n      That made me oft full sore agrevyd.”[60]\\n\\n    [60] _Ibid._ p. 189.\\n\\nRipley did much to popularise the works of Raymond Lully in England, but\\ndoes not appear to have added to the knowledge of practical chemistry.\\nHis _Bosom Book_, which contains an alleged method for preparing the\\nStone, will be found in the _Collectanea Chemica_ (1893).\\n\\n\\nThomas Norton (15th Century).\\n\\n§ =45.= =Thomas Norton=, the author of the celebrated _Ordinall of\\nAlchemy_, was probably born shortly before the commencement of the\\nfifteenth century. The _Ordinall_, which is written in verse (and which\\nwill be found in Ashmole’s _Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum_),[61] is\\nanonymous, but the author’s identity is revealed by a curious device.\\nThe initial syllables of the proem and of the first six chapters,\\ntogether with the first line of the seventh chapter, give the following\\ncouplet:--\\n\\n    “Tomais Norton of Briseto,\\n    A parfet _Master_ ye maie him call trowe.”\\n\\n    [61] A prose version will be found in _The Hermetic Museum_\\n    translated back into English from a Latin translation by Maier.\\n\\nSamuel Norton, the grandson of Thomas, who was also an alchemist, says\\nthat Thomas Norton was a member of the privy chamber of Edward IV.\\nNorton’s distinctive views regarding the generation of the metals we\\nhave already mentioned (see § 20). He taught that true knowledge of the\\nArt of Alchemy could only be obtained by word of mouth from an adept,\\nand in his _Ordinall_ he gives an account of his own initiation. He\\ntells us that he was instructed by his master (probably Sir George\\nRipley) and learnt the secrets of the Art in forty days, at the age of\\ntwenty-eight. He does not, however, appear to have reaped the fruits of\\nthis knowledge. Twice, he tells us, did he prepare the Elixir, and twice\\nwas it stolen from him; and he is said to have died in 1477, after\\nruining himself and his friends by his unsuccessful experiments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nTHE ALCHEMISTS (_continued_)\\n\\n(B. PARACELSUS AND AFTER)\\n\\n\\nParacelsus (1493-1541.)\\n\\n§ =46.= That erratic genius, =Paracelsus=--or, to give him his correct\\nname, Philip (?) Aureole (?) =Theophrast Bombast von Hohenheim=--whose\\nportrait forms the frontispiece to the present work--was born at\\nEinsiedeln in Switzerland in 1493. He studied the alchemistic and\\nmedical arts under his father, who was a physician, and continued his\\nstudies later at the University of Basle. He also gave some time to the\\nstudy of magic and the occult sciences under the famous Trithemius of\\nSpanheim. Paracelsus, however, found the merely theoretical “book\\nlearning” of the university curriculum unsatisfactory and betook himself\\nto the mines, where he might study the nature of metals at first hand.\\nHe then spent several years in travelling, visiting some of the chief\\ncountries of Europe. At last he returned to Basle, the chair of Medical\\nScience of his old university being bestowed upon him. The works of\\nIsaac of Holland had inspired him with the desire to improve upon the\\nmedical science of his day, and in his lectures (which were, contrary\\nto the usual custom, delivered not in Latin, but in the German language)\\nhe denounced in violent terms the teachings of Galen and Avicenna, who\\nwere until then the accredited authorities on medical matters. His use\\nof the German tongue, his coarseness in criticism and his intense\\nself-esteem, combined with the fact that he did lay bare many of the\\nmedical follies and frauds of his day, brought him into very general\\ndislike with the rest of the physicians, and the municipal authorities\\nsiding with the aggrieved apothecaries and physicians, whose methods\\nParacelsus had exposed, he fled from Basle and resumed his former roving\\nlife. He was, so we are told, a man of very intemperate habits, being\\nseldom sober (a statement seriously open to doubt); but on the other\\nhand, he certainly accomplished a very large number of most remarkable\\ncures, and, judging from his writings, he was inspired by lofty and\\nnoble ideals and a fervent belief in the Christian religion. He died in\\n1541.\\n\\nParacelsus combined in himself such opposite characteristics that it is\\na matter of difficulty to criticise him aright. As says Professor\\nFerguson: “It is most difficult .\\xa0.\\xa0. to ascertain what his true\\ncharacter really was, to appreciate aright this man of fervid\\nimagination, of powerful and persistent conviction, of unbated honesty\\nand love of truth, of keen insight into the errors (as he thought them)\\nof his time, of a merciless will to lay bare these errors and to reform\\nthe abuses to which they gave rise, who in an instant offends by his\\nboasting, his grossness, his want of self-respect. It is a problem how\\nto reconcile his ignorance, his weakness, his superstition, his crude\\nnotions, his erroneous observations, his ridiculous inferences and\\ntheories, with his grasp of method, his lofty views of the true scope of\\nmedicine, his lucid statements, his incisive and epigrammatic criticisms\\nof men and motives.”[62] It is also a problem of considerable difficulty\\nto determine which of the many books attributed to him are really his\\ngenuine works, and consequently what his views on certain points exactly\\nwere.\\n\\n    [62] JOHN FERGUSON, M.A.: Article “Paracelsus,” _Encyclopædia\\n    Britannica_, 9th edition (1885), vol. xviii. p. 236.\\n\\n\\nViews of Paracelsus.\\n\\n§ =47.= Paracelsus was the first to recognise the desirability of\\ninvestigating the physical universe with a motive other than\\nalchemistic. He taught that “the object of chemistry is not to make\\ngold, but to prepare medicines,” and founded the school of\\nIatro-chemistry or Medical Chemistry. This synthesis of chemistry with\\nmedicine was of very great benefit to each science; new possibilities of\\nchemical investigation were opened up now that the aim was not purely\\nalchemistic. Paracelsus’s central theory was that of the analogy between\\nman, the microcosm, and the world or macrocosm. He regarded all the\\nactions that go on in the human body as of a chemical nature, and he\\nthought that illness was the result of a disproportion in the body\\nbetween the quantities of the three great principles--sulphur, mercury,\\nand salt--which he regarded as constituting all things; for example, he\\nconsidered an excess of sulphur as the cause of fever, since sulphur was\\nthe fiery principle, &c. The basis of the iatro-chemical doctrines,\\nnamely, that the healthy human body is a particular combination of\\nchemical substances: illness the result of some change in this\\ncombination, and hence curable only by chemical medicines, expresses a\\ncertain truth, and is undoubtedly a great improvement upon the ideas of\\nthe ancients. But in the elaboration of his medical doctrines Paracelsus\\nfell a prey to exaggeration and the fantastic, and many of his theories\\nappear to be highly ridiculous. This extravagance is also very\\npronounced in the alchemistic works attributed to him; for example, the\\nbelief in the artificial creation of minute living creatures resembling\\nmen (called “homunculi”)--a belief of the utmost absurdity, if we are to\\nunderstand it literally. On the other hand, his writings do contain much\\ntrue teaching of a mystical nature; his doctrine of the correspondence\\nof man with the universe considered as a whole, for example, certainly\\nbeing radically true, though fantastically stated and developed by\\nParacelsus himself.\\n\\n\\nIatro-Chemistry.\\n\\n§ =48.= Between the pupils of Paracelsus and the older school of\\nmedicine, as might well be supposed, a battle royal was waged for a\\nconsiderable time, which ultimately concluded, if not with a full\\nvindication of Paracelsus’s teaching, yet with the acceptance of the\\nfundamental iatro-chemical doctrines. Henceforward it is necessary to\\ndistinguish between the chemists and the alchemists--to distinguish\\nthose who pursued chemical studies with the object of discovering and\\npreparing useful medicines, and later those who pursued such studies for\\ntheir own sake, from those whose object was the transmutation of the\\n“base” metals into gold, whether from purely selfish motives, or with\\nthe desire to demonstrate on the physical plane the validity of the\\ndoctrines of Mysticism. However, during the following century or two we\\nfind, very often, the chemist and the alchemist united in one and the\\nsame person. Men such as Glauber and Boyle, whose names will ever be\\nremembered by chemists, did not doubt the possibility of performing the\\n_magnum opus_. In the present chapter, however, we shall confine our\\nattention for the most part to those men who may be regarded, for one\\nreason or another, particularly as _alchemists_. And the alchemists of\\nthe period we are now considering present a very great diversity. On the\\none hand, we have men of much chemical knowledge and skill such as\\nLibavius and van Helmont, on the other hand we have those who stand\\nequally as high as exponents of mystic wisdom--men such as Jacob Boehme\\nand, to a less extent, Thomas Vaughan. We have those, who, although they\\ndid not enrich the science of Chemistry with any new discoveries, were,\\nnevertheless, regarded as masters of the Hermetic Art; and, finally, we\\nhave alchemists of the Edward Kelley and “Cagliostro” type, whose main\\nobject was their own enrichment at their neighbours’ expense. Before,\\nhowever, proceeding to an account of the lives and teachings of these\\nmen, there is one curious matter--perhaps the most remarkable of all\\nhistorical curiosities--that calls for some brief consideration. We\\nrefer to the “far-famed” Rosicrucian Society.\\n\\n\\nThe Rosicrucian Society.\\n\\n§ =49.= The exoteric history of the Rosicrucian Society commences with\\nthe year 1614. In that year there was published at Cassel in Germany a\\npamphlet entitled _The Discovery of the Fraternity of the Meritorious\\nOrder of the Rosy Cross, addressed to the Learned in General and the\\nGovernors of Europe_. After a discussion of the momentous question of\\nthe general reformation of the world, which was to be accomplished\\nthrough the medium of a secret confederacy of the wisest and most\\nphilanthropic men, the pamphlet proceeds to inform its readers that such\\nan association is in existence, founded over one hundred years ago by\\nthe famous C.R.C., grand initiate in the mysteries of Alchemy, whose\\nhistory (which is clearly of a fabulous or symbolical nature) is given.\\nThe book concludes by inviting the wise men of the time to join the\\nFraternity, directing those who wished to do so to indicate their desire\\nby the publication of printed letters, which should come into the hands\\nof the Brotherhood. As might well be expected, the pamphlet was the\\ncause of considerable interest and excitement, but although many letters\\nwere printed, apparently none of them were vouchsafed a reply. The\\nfollowing year a further pamphlet appeared, _The Confession of the\\nRosicrucian Fraternity, addressed to the Learned in Europe_, and in\\n1616, _The Chymical Nuptials of Christian Rosencreutz_. This latter book\\nis a remarkable allegorical romance, describing how an old man, a\\nlifelong student of the alchemistic Art, was present at the\\naccomplishment of the _magnum opus_ in the year 1459. An enormous amount\\nof controversy took place; it was plain to some that the Society had\\ndeluded them, whilst others hotly maintained its claims; but after about\\nfour years had passed, the excitement had subsided, and the subject\\nceased, for the time being, to arouse any particular interest.\\n\\nSome writers, even in recent times, more gifted for romance than for\\nhistorical research, have seen in the Rosicrucian Society a secret\\nconfederacy of immense antiquity and of stupendous powers, consisting of\\nthe great initiates of all ages, supposed to be in possession of the\\narch secrets of alchemistic art. It is abundantly evident, however, that\\nit was nothing of the sort. It is clear from an examination of the\\npamphlets already mentioned that they are animated by Lutheran ideals;\\nand it is of interest to note that Luther’s seal contained both the\\ncross and the rose--whence the term “Rosicrucian.” The generally\\naccepted theory regards the pamphlets as a sort of elaborate hoax\\nperpetrated by Valentine Andreä, a young and benevolent Lutheran divine;\\nbut more, however, than a mere hoax. As the late Mr. R. A. Vaughan\\nwrote: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. this Andreä writes the _Discovery of the Rosicrucian\\nBrotherhood, a jeu-d’esprit_ with a serious purpose, just as an\\nexperiment to see whether something cannot be done by combined effort to\\nremedy the defect and abuses--social, educational, and religious, so\\nlamented by all good men. He thought there were many Andreäs scattered\\nthroughout Europe--how powerful would be their united systematic action!\\n.\\xa0.\\xa0. He hoped that the few nobler minds whom he desired to organize\\nwould see through the veil of fiction in which he had invested his\\nproposal; that he might communicate personally with some such, if they\\nshould appear; or that his book might lead them to form among themselves\\na practical philanthropic confederacy, answering to the serious purpose\\nhe had embodied in his fiction.”[63] His scheme was a failure, and on\\nseeing its result, Andreä, not daring to reveal himself as the author of\\nthe pamphlets, did his best to put a stop to the folly by writing\\nseveral works in criticism of the Society and its claims. Mr. A. E.\\nWaite, however, whose work on the subject should be consulted for\\nfurther information, rejects this theory, and suggests that the\\nRosicrucian Society was probably identical with the _Militia Crucifera\\nEvangelica_, a secret society founded in Nuremburg by the Lutheran\\nalchemist and mystic, Simon Studion.[64]\\n\\n    [63] ROBERT ALFRED VAUGHAN, B.A.: _Hours with the Mystics_ (7th\\n    edition, 1895), vol. ii. bk. 8, chap. ix. p. 134.\\n\\n    [64] ARTHUR EDWARD WAITE: _The Real History of the Rosicrucians_,\\n    (1887).\\n\\n\\nThomas Charnock (1524-1581).\\n\\n§ =50.= We must now turn our attention to the lives and teachings of the\\nalchemists of the period under consideration, treating them, as far as\\npossible, in chronological order; whence the first alchemist to come\\nunder our notice is Thomas Charnock.\\n\\n=Thomas Charnock= was born at Faversham (Kent), either in the year 1524\\nor in 1526. After some travels over England he settled at Oxford,\\ncarrying on experiments in Alchemy. In 1557 he wrote his _Breviary of\\nPhilosophy_. This work is almost entirely autobiographical, describing\\nCharnock’s alchemistic experiences. He tells us that he was initiated\\ninto the mysteries of the Hermetic Art by a certain James S. of\\nSalisbury; he also had another master, an old blind man, who on his\\ndeath-bed instructed Charnock. Unfortunately, however, Thomas was doomed\\nto failure in his experiments. On the first attempt his apparatus caught\\nfire and his work was destroyed. His next experiments were ruined by the\\nnegligence of a servant. His final misfortune shall be described in his\\nown words. He had started the work for a third time, and had spent much\\nmoney on his fire, hoping to be shortly rewarded. .\\xa0.\\xa0.\\n\\n    “Then a _Gentleman_ that oughte me great mallice\\n    Caused me to be prest to goe serve at _Callys_:\\n    When I saw there was no other boote,\\n    But that I must goe spight of my heart roote;\\n    In my fury I tooke a Hatchet in my hand,\\n    And brake all my Worke whereas it did stand.”[65]\\n\\n    [65] THOMAS CHARNOCK: _The Breviary of Naturall Philosophy_ (see\\n    _Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum_, edited by Ashmole, 1652, p. 295.)\\n\\nThomas Charnock married in 1562 a Miss Agnes Norden. He died in 1581. It\\nis, perhaps, unnecessary to say that his name does not appear in the\\nhistory of Chemistry.\\n\\n\\nAndreas Libavius (1540-1616.)\\n\\n§ =51.= =Andreas Libavius= was born at Halle in Germany in 1540, where\\nhe studied medicine and practiced for a short time as a physician. He\\naccepted the fundamental iatro-chemical doctrines, at the same time,\\nhowever, criticising certain of the more extravagant views expressed by\\nParacelsus. He was a firm believer in the transmutation of the metals,\\nbut his own activities were chiefly directed to the preparation of new\\nand better medicines. He enriched the science of Chemistry by many\\nvaluable discoveries, and tin tetra-chloride, which he was the first to\\nprepare, is still known by the name of _spiritus fumans Libavii_.\\nLibavius was a man possessed of keen powers of observation; and his work\\non Chemistry, which contains a full account of the knowledge of the\\nscience of his time, may be regarded as the first text-book of\\nChemistry. It was held in high esteem for a considerable time, being\\nreprinted on several occasions.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 9.\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF EDWARD KELLEY.\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF JOHN DEE.\\n\\n_To face page 68_]]\\n\\n\\nEdward Kelley (1555-1595) and John Dee (1527-1608.)\\n\\n§ =52.= Edward Kelley or Kelly (see plate 9) was born at Worcester on\\nAugust 1, 1555. His life is so obscured by various traditions that it is\\nvery difficult to arrive at the truth concerning it. The latest, and\\nprobably the best, account will be found in Miss Charlotte Fell Smith’s\\n_John Dee_ (1909). Edward Kelley, according to some accounts, was\\nbrought up as an apothecary.[66] He is also said to have entered Oxford\\nUniversity under the pseudonym of Talbot.[67] Later, he practised as a\\nnotary in London. He is said to have committed a forgery, for which he\\nhad his ears cropped; but another account, which supposes him to have\\navoided this penalty by making his escape to Wales, is not improbable.\\nOther crimes of which he is accused are coining and necromancy. He was\\nprobably not guilty of all these crimes, but that he was undoubtedly a\\ncharlatan and profligate the sequel will make plain. We are told that\\nabout the time of his alleged escape to Wales, whilst in the\\nneighbourhood of Glastonbury Abbey, he became possessed, by a lucky\\nchance, of a manuscript by St. Dunstan setting forth the grand secrets\\nof Alchemy, together with some of the two transmuting tinctures, both\\nwhite and red,[68] which had been discovered in a tomb near by. His\\nfriendship with John Dee, or Dr. Dee as he is generally called,\\ncommenced in 1582. Now, =John Dee= (see plate 9) was undoubtedly a\\nmathematician of considerable erudition. He was also an astrologer, and\\nwas much interested in experiments in “crystal-gazing,” for which\\npurpose he employed a speculum of polished cannel-coal, and by means of\\nwhich he believed that he had communication with the inhabitants of\\nspiritual spheres. It appears that Kelley, who probably did possess some\\nmediumistic powers, the results of which he augmented by means of fraud,\\ninterested himself in these experiments, and not only became the\\ndoctor’s “scryer,” but also gulled him into the belief that he was in\\nthe possession of the arch-secrets of Alchemy. In 1583, Kelley and his\\nlearned dupe left England together with their wives and a Polish\\nnobleman, staying firstly at Cracovia and afterwards at Prague, where it\\nis not unlikely that the Emperor Rudolph II. knighted Kelley. As\\ninstances of the belief which the doctor had in Kelley’s powers as an\\nalchemist, we may note that in his Private Diary under the date December\\n19, 1586, Dee records that Kelley performed a transmutation for the\\nbenefit of one Edward Garland and his brother Francis;[69] and under\\nthe date May 10, 1588, we find the following recorded: “E.K. did open\\nthe great secret to me, God be thanked!”[70] That he was not always\\nwithout doubts as to Kelley’s honesty, however, is evident from other\\nentries in his Diary. In 1587 occurred an event which must be recorded\\nto the partners’ lasting shame. To cap his former impositions, Kelley\\ninformed the doctor that by the orders of a spirit which had appeared to\\nhim in the crystal, they were to share “their two wives in common”; to\\nwhich arrangement, after some further persuasion, Dee consented.\\nKelley’s profligacy and violent temper, however, had already been the\\ncause of some disagreement between him and the doctor, and this incident\\nleading to a further quarrel, the erstwhile friends parted. In 1589, the\\nEmperor Rudolph imprisoned Kelley, the price of his freedom being the\\ntransmutative secret, or a substantial quantity of gold, at least,\\nprepared by its aid. He was, however, released in 1593; but died in\\n1595; according to one account, as the result of an accident incurred\\nwhile attempting to escape from a second imprisonment. Dee merely\\nrecords that he received news to the effect that Kelley “was slayne.”\\n\\n    [66] See, for example, WILLIAM LILLY: _History of His Life and\\n    Times_ (1715, reprinted in 1822, p. 227).\\n\\n    [67] See ANTHONY À WOOD’S account of Kelley’s life in _Athenæ\\n    Oxonienses_ (3rd edition, edited by Philip Bliss, vol. i. col. 639.)\\n\\n    [68] William Lilly, the astrologer, in his _History of His Life and\\n    Times_ (1822 reprint, pp. 225-226), relates a different story\\n    regarding the manner in which Kelley is supposed to have obtained\\n    the Great Medicine, but as it is told at third hand, it is of little\\n    importance. We do not suppose that there can be much doubt that the\\n    truth was that Dee and others were deceived by some skilful\\n    conjuring tricks, for whatever else Kelley may have been, he\\n    certainly was a very ingenious fellow.\\n\\n    [69] _The Private Diary of Dr. John Dee_ (The Camden Society, 1842),\\n    p. 22.\\n\\n    [70] _The Private Diary of Dr. John Dee_ (The Camden Society, 1842),\\n    p. 27.\\n\\nIt was during his incarceration that he wrote an alchemistic work\\nentitled _The Stone of the Philosophers_, which consists largely of\\nquotations from older alchemistic writings. His other works on Alchemy\\nwere probably written at an earlier period.[71]\\n\\n    [71] An English translation of Kelley’s alchemistic works were\\n    published under the editorship of Mr. A. E. Waite, in 1893.\\n\\n\\nHenry Khunrath (1560-1605).\\n\\n§ =53.= =Henry Khunrath= was born in Saxony in the second half of the\\nsixteenth century. He was a follower of Paracelsus, and travelled about\\nGermany, practising as a physician. “This German alchemist,” says Mr. A.\\nE. Waite, “.\\xa0.\\xa0. is claimed as a hierophant of the psychic side of the\\n_magnum opus_, and .\\xa0.\\xa0. was undoubtedly aware of the larger issues, of\\nHermetic theorems”; he describes Khunrath’s chief work, _Amphitheatrum\\nSapientiæ Æternæ_, &c., as “purely mystical and magical.”[72]\\n\\n    [72] A. E. WAITE: _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_ (1888), p.\\n    159.\\n\\n\\nAlexander Sethon (?-1604) and Michael Sendivogius (1566?-1646).\\n\\n§ =54.= The date and birthplace of =Alexander Sethon=, a Scottish\\nalchemist, do not appear to have been recorded, but =Michael\\nSendivogius= was probably born in Moravia about 1566. Sethon, we are\\ntold, was in possession of the arch-secrets of Alchemy. He visited\\nHolland in 1602, proceeded after a time to Italy, and passed through\\nBasle to Germany; meanwhile he is said to have performed many\\ntransmutations. Ultimately arriving at Dresden, however, he fell into\\nthe clutches of the young Elector, Christian II., who, in order to\\nextort his secret, cast him into prison, and put him to the torture, but\\nwithout avail. Now, it so happened that Sendivogius, who was in quest of\\nthe Philosopher’s Stone, was staying at Dresden, and hearing of Sethon’s\\nimprisonment obtained permission to visit him. Sendivogius offered to\\neffect Sethon’s escape in return for assistance in his alchemistic\\npursuits, to which arrangement the Scottish alchemist willingly agreed.\\nAfter some considerable outlay of money in bribery, Sendivogius’s plan\\nof escape was successfully carried out, and Sethon found himself a free\\nman; but he refused to betray the high secrets of Hermetic philosophy to\\nhis rescuer. However, before his death, which occurred shortly\\nafterwards, he presented him with an ounce of the transmutative powder.\\nSendivogius soon used up this powder, we are told, in effecting\\ntransmutations and cures, and, being fond of expensive living, he\\nmarried Sethon’s widow, in the hope that she was in the possession of\\nthe transmutative secret. In this, however, he was disappointed; she\\nknew nothing of the matter, but she had the manuscript of an alchemistic\\nwork written by her late husband. Shortly afterwards Sendivogius printed\\nat Prague a book entitled _The New Chemical Light_ under the name of\\n“Cosmopolita,” which is said to be this work of Sethon’s but which\\nSendivogius claimed for his own by the insertion of his name on the\\ntitle-page, in the form of an anagram. The tract _On Sulphur_ which was\\nprinted at the end of later editions, however, is said to have been the\\ngenuine work of the Moravian. Whilst his powder lasted, Sendivogius\\ntravelled about, performing, we are told, many transmutations. He was\\ntwice imprisoned in order to extort the secrets of Alchemy from him, on\\none occasion escaping, and on the other occasion obtaining his release\\nfrom the Emperor Rudolph. Afterwards, he appears to have degenerated\\ninto an impostor, but this is said to have been a _finesse_ to hide his\\ntrue character as an alchemistic adept. He died in 1646.[73]\\n\\n    [73] See F. B.: _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_ (1815), pp.\\n    66-69.\\n\\nThe _New Chemical Light_ was held in great esteem by the alchemists. The\\nfirst part treats at length of the generation of the metals and also of\\nthe Philosopher’s Stone, and claims to be based on practical experience.\\nThe seed of Nature, we are told, is one, but various products result on\\naccount of the different conditions of development. An imaginary\\nconversation between Mercury, an Alchemist and Nature which is appended,\\nis not without a touch of humour. Says the Alchemist, in despair, “Now I\\nsee that I know nothing; only I must not say so. For I should lose the\\ngood opinion of my neighbours, and they would no longer entrust me with\\nmoney for my experiments. I must therefore go on saying that I know\\neverything; for there are many that expect me to do great things for\\nthem. .\\xa0.\\xa0. There are many countries, and many greedy persons who will\\nsuffer themselves to be gulled by my promises of mountains of gold. Thus\\nday will follow day, and in the meantime the King or the donkey will\\ndie, or I myself.”[74] The second part treats of the Elements and\\nPrinciples (see §§ 17 and 19).\\n\\n    [74] _The New Chemical Light_, Part I.

Brunn]\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF MICHAEL MAIER.\\n\\n_To face page 72_]]\\n\\n\\nMichael Maier (1568-1622).\\n\\n§ =55.= =Michael Maier= (see plate 10) was born at Rendsberg (in\\nHolstein) about 1568. He studied medicine assiduously, becoming a most\\nsuccessful physician, and he was ennobled by Rudolf II. Later on,\\nhowever, he took up the subject of Alchemy, and is said to have ruined\\nhis health and wasted his fortune in the pursuit of the alchemistic\\n_ignis fatuus_--the Stone of the Philosophers--travelling about Germany\\nand elsewhere in order to have converse with those who were regarded as\\nadepts in the Art. He took a prominent part in the famous Rosicrucian\\ncontroversy (see § 49), defending the claims of the alleged society in\\nseveral tracts. He is said, on the one hand, to have been admitted as a\\nmember of the fraternity; and on the other hand, to have himself founded\\na similar institution. A full account of his views will be found in the\\nRev. J. B. Craven’s _Count Michael Maier: Life and Writings_ (1910). He\\nwas a very learned man, but his works are somewhat obscure and abound in\\nfanciful allegories. He read an alchemistic meaning into the ancient\\nfables concerning the Egyptian and Greek gods and heroes. Like most\\nalchemists, he held the supposed virtues of mercury in high esteem. In\\nhis _Lusus Serius: or, Serious Passe-time_, for example, he supposes a\\nParliament of the various creatures of the world to meet, in order that\\nMan might choose the noblest of them as king over all the rest. The\\ncalf, the sheep, the goose, the oyster, the bee, the silkworm, flax and\\nmercury are the chosen representatives, each of which discourses in\\nturn. It will be unnecessary to state that Mercury wins the day. Thus\\ndoes Maier eulogise it: “Thou art the miracle, splendour and light of\\nthe world. Thou art the glory, ornament, and supporter of the Earth.\\nThou art the Asyle, Anchor, and tye of the Universe. Next to the minde\\nof Man, God Created nothing more Noble, more Glorious, or more\\nProfitable.”[75] His _Subtle Allegory concerning the Secrets of Alchemy,\\nvery useful to possess and pleasant to read_, will be found in the\\n_Hermetic Museum_, together with his _Golden Tripod_, consisting of\\ntranslations of “Valentine’s” “_Practica_” and _Twelve Keys_, Norton’s\\n_Ordinal_ and Cremer’s spurious _Testament_.\\n\\n    [75] MICHAEL MAIER: _Lusus Serius: or Serious Passe-time_ (1654), p.\\n    138.\\n\\n[Illustration: Plate 11.\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF JACOB BOEHME.\\n\\n_To face page 74_]]\\n\\n\\nJacob Boehme (1575-1624.)\\n\\n§ =56.= =Jacob Boehme=, or Behmen (see plate 11), was born at Alt\\nSeidenberg, a village near Görlitz, in 1575. His parents being poor, the\\neducation he received was of a very rudimentary nature, and when his\\nschooling days were over, Jacob was apprenticed to a shoemaker. His\\nreligious nature caused him often to admonish his fellow-apprentices,\\nwhich behaviour ultimately caused him to be dismissed. He travelled\\nabout as a journeyman shoemaker, returning, however, to Görlitz in 1594,\\nwhere he married and settled in business. He claims to have experienced\\na wonderful vision in 1598, and to have had a similar vision two years\\nlater. In these visions, the first of which lasted for several days, he\\nbelieved that he saw into the inmost secrets of nature; but what at\\nfirst appeared dim and vague became clear and coherent in a third\\nvision, which he tells us was vouchsafed to him in 1610. It was then\\nthat he wrote his first book, the _Aurora_, which he composed for\\nhimself only, in order that he should not forget the mysteries disclosed\\nto him. At a later period he produced a large number of treatises of a\\nmystical-religious nature, having spent the intervening years in\\nimproving his early education. These books aroused the ire of the\\nnarrow-minded ecclesiastical authorities of the town, and Jacob suffered\\nconsiderable persecution in consequence. He visited Dresden in 1624, and\\nin the same year was there taken ill with a fever. Returning to Görlitz,\\nhe expired in a condition of ecstasy.\\n\\nJacob Boehme was an alchemist of a purely transcendental order. He had,\\nit appears, acquired some knowledge of Chemistry during his apprentice\\ndays, and he employed the language of Alchemy in the elaboration of his\\nsystem of mystical philosophy. With this lofty mystical-religious system\\nwe cannot here deal; Boehme is, indeed, often accounted the greatest of\\ntrue Christian mystics; but although conscious of his superiority over\\nmany minor lights, we think this title is due to Emanuel Swedenborg. The\\nquestion of the validity of his visions is also one which lies beyond\\nthe scope of the present work;[76] we must confine our attention to\\nBoehme as an alchemist. The Philosopher’s Stone, in Boehme’s\\nterminology, is the Spirit of Christ which must “tincture” the\\nindividual soul. In one place he says, “_The Phylosophers Stone_ is a\\nvery dark disesteemed Stone, of a _Gray_ colour, but therein lyeth the\\nhighest Tincture.”[77] In the transcendental sense, this is reminiscent\\nof the words of Isaiah: “He hath no form nor comeliness; and when we see\\nhim, there is no beauty that we should desire him. .\\xa0.\\xa0. He was despised\\nand we esteemed him not,” &c.[78]\\n\\n    [76] For a general discussion of spiritual visions see the present\\n    writer’s _Matter, Spirit and the Cosmos_ (Rider, 1910), Chapter IV.,\\n    “On Matter and Spirit.” Undoubtedly Boehme’s visions involved a\\n    valuable element of truth, but at the same time much that was purely\\n    relative and subjective.\\n\\n    [77] JACOB BOEHME: _Epistles_ (translated by J.

He devoted himself to the study of medicine, at first following\\nGalen, but afterwards accepting in part the teachings of Paracelsus;\\nand he helped to a large extent in the overthrow of the old medical\\ndoctrines. His purely chemical researches were also of great value to\\nthe science. He was a man of profound knowledge, of a religious\\ntemperament, and he possessed a marked liking for the mystical. He was\\ninspired by the writings of Thomas à Kempis to imitate Christ in all\\nthings, and he practised medicine, therefore, as a work of benevolence,\\nasking no fee for his services. At the same time, moreover, he was a\\nfirm believer in the powers of the Philosopher’s Stone, claiming to have\\nhimself successfully performed the transmutation of the metals on more\\nthan one occasion, though unacquainted with the composition of the\\nmedicine employed (see § 62). Many of his theoretical views are highly\\nfantastical. He lived a life devoted to scientific research, and died in\\n1644.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 12.\\n\\nPORTRAITS OF J. B. AND F. M. VAN HELMONT.\\n\\n(From the Frontispiece to J. B. van Helmont’s _Oriatrike_).\\n\\n_To face page 76_]]\\n\\nVan Helmont regarded water as the primary element out of which all\\nthings are produced. He denied that fire was an element or anything\\nmaterial at all, and he did not accept the sulphur-mercury-salt theory.\\nTo him is due the word “gas”--before his time various gases were looked\\nupon as mere varieties of air--and he also made a distinction between\\ngases (which could not be condensed)[79] and vapours (which give liquids\\non cooling). In particular he investigated the gas that is now known as\\ncarbon-dioxide (carbonic anhydride), which he termed _gas sylvestre_;\\nbut he lacked suitable apparatus for the collection of gases, and\\nhence was led in many cases to erroneous conclusions.\\n\\n    [79] It has since been discovered that all gases can be condensed,\\n    given a sufficient degree of cold and pressure.\\n\\n=Francis Mercurius van Helmont= (see plate 12), the son of John Baptist,\\nborn in 1618, gained the reputation of having also achieved the _magnum\\nopus_, since he appeared to live very luxuriously upon a limited income.\\nHe was a skilled chemist and physician, but held many queer theories,\\nmetempsychosis included.\\n\\n\\nJohann Rudolf Glauber (1604-1668).\\n\\n§ =58.= =Johann Rudolf Glauber= was born at Karlstadt in 1604. Of his\\nlife little is known. He appears to have travelled about Germany a good\\ndeal, afterwards visiting Amsterdam, where he died in 1668. He was of a\\nvery patriotic nature, and a most ardent investigator in the realm of\\nChemistry. He accepted the main iatro-chemical doctrines, but gave most\\nof his attention to applied Chemistry. He enriched the science with many\\nimportant discoveries; and crystallised sodium sulphate is still called\\n“Glauber’s Salt.” Glauber, himself, attributed remarkable medicinal\\npowers to this compound. He was a firm believer in the claims of\\nAlchemy, and held many fantastic ideas.\\n\\n\\nThomas Vaughan (“Eugenius Philalethes”) (1622-1666.)\\n\\n§ =59.= =Thomas Vaughan=, who wrote under the name of “=Eugenius\\nPhilalethes=,” was born at Newton in Brecknockshire in 1622. He was\\neducated at Jesus College, Oxford, graduating as a Bachelor of Arts, and\\nbeing made a fellow of his college. He appears also to have taken holy\\norders and to have had the living of St. Bridget’s (Brecknockshire)\\nconferred on him.[80] During the civil wars he bore arms for the king,\\nbut his allegiance to the Royalist cause led to his being accused of\\n“drunkenness, swearing, incontinency and bearing arms for the King”; and\\nhe appears to have been deprived of his living. He retired to Oxford and\\ngave himself up to study and chemical research. He is to be regarded as\\nan alchemist of the transcendental order. His views as to the nature of\\nthe true Philosopher’s Stone may be gathered from the following\\nquotation: “This, reader,” he says, speaking of the mystical\\nillumination, “is the Christian Philosopher’s Stone, a Stone so often\\ninculcated in Scripture. This is the Rock in the wildernesse, because in\\ngreat obscurity, and few there are that know the right way unto it. This\\nis the Stone of Fire in Ezekiel; this is the Stone with Seven Eyes upon\\nit in Zacharie, and this is the White Stone with the New Name in the\\nRevelation. But in the Gospel, where Christ himself speakes, who was\\nborn to discover mysteries and communicate Heaven to Earth, it is more\\nclearly described.”[81] At the same time he appears to have carried out\\nexperiments in physical Alchemy, and is said to have met with his death\\nin 1666 through accidentally inhaling the fumes of some mercury with\\nwhich he was experimenting.\\n\\n    [80] See ANTHONY À WOOD: _Athenæ Oxonienses_, edited by Philip\\n    Bliss, vol. iii. (1817), cols. 722-726.\\n\\n    [81] THOMAS VAUGHAN (“Eugenius Philalethes”): _Anima Magica\\n    Abscondita_ (see _The Magical Writings of Thomas Vaughan_, edited by\\n    A. E. Waite, 1888, p. 71).\\n\\nThomas Vaughan was an ardent disciple of Cornelius Agrippa, the\\nsixteenth-century theosophist. He held the peripatetic philosophy in\\nvery slight esteem. He was a man devoted to God, though probably guilty\\nof some youthful follies, full of love towards his wife, and with an\\nintense desire for the solution of the great problems of Nature. Amongst\\nhis chief works, which are by no means wanting in flashes of mystic\\nwisdom, may be mentioned _Anthroposophia Theomagica_, _Anima Magica\\nAbscondita_ (which were published together), and _Magia Adamica; or, the\\nAntiquitie of Magic_. With regard to his views as expressed in the first\\ntwo of these books, a controversy ensued between Vaughan and Henry\\nMoore, which was marked by considerable acrimony.\\n\\n\\n“Eirenæus Philalethes” (1623?-?) and George Starkey (?-1665).\\n\\n§ =60.= The use of the pseudonym “Philalethes” has not been confined to\\none alchemist. The cosmopolitan adept who wrote under the name of\\n“=Eirenæus Philalethes=,” has been confused, on the one hand, with\\nThomas Vaughan, on the other hand with George Starkey (?-1665). He has\\nalso been identified with Dr. Robert Child (1613-1654); but his real\\nidentity remains shrouded in mystery.[82] =George Starkey= (or Stirk),\\nthe son of George Stirk, minister of the Church of England in Bermuda,\\ngraduated at Harvard in 1646 and practised medicine in the United States\\nof America from 1647 to 1650. In 1651 he came to England and practised\\nmedicine in London. He died of the plague in 1665. In 1654-5 he\\npublished _The Marrow of Alchemy_, by “Eirenæus Philoponos\\nPhilalethes,” which some think he had stolen from his Hermetic Master.\\nOther works by “Eirenæus Philalethes” appeared after Starkey’s death and\\nbecame immensely popular. The _Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the\\nKing_ (the most famous of these) and the _Three Treatises_ of the same\\nauthor will be found in _The Hermetic Museum_. Some of his views have\\nalready been noted (see §§ 1 and 22). On certain points he differed from\\nthe majority of the alchemists. He denied that fire was an element, and,\\nalso, that bodies are formed by mixture of the elements. According to\\nhim there is one principle in the metals, namely, mercury, which arises\\nfrom the aqueous element, and is termed “metalically differentiated\\nwater, _i.e._, it is water passed into that stage of development, in\\nwhich it can no longer produce anything but mineral substances.”[83]\\nPhilalethes’s views as to “metallic seed” are also of considerable\\ninterest. Of the seed of gold, which he regarded as the seed, also, of\\nall other metals, he says: “The seed of animals and vegetables is\\nsomething separate, and may be cut out, or otherwise separately\\nexhibited; but metallic seed is diffused throughout the metal, and\\ncontained in all its smallest parts; neither can it be discerned from\\nits body: its extraction is therefore a task which may well tax the\\ningenuity of the most experienced philosopher. .\\xa0.\\xa0.”[84] Well might\\nthis have been said of the electron of modern scientific theory.\\n\\n    [82] See Mr. A. E. Waite’s _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_,\\n    art. “Eirenæus Philalethes,” and the Biographical Preface to his\\n    _The Works of Thomas Vaughan_ (1919); also the late Professor\\n    Ferguson’s “‘The Marrow of Alchemy’,” _The Journal of The Alchemical\\n    Society_, vol. iii. (1915), pp. 106 _et seq._, and Professor G. L.\\n    Kittredge’s _Doctor Robert Child, The Remonstrant_ (Camb., Mass.,\\n    1919). The last mentioned writer strongly urges the identification\\n    of “Eirenæus Philalethes” with George Starkey.\\n\\n    [83] “EIRENÆUS PHILALETHES”: _The Metamorphosis of Metals_ (see _The\\n    Hermetic Museum_, vol. ii. p. 236).

That many _apparent_ transmutations\\noccurred, the observers being either self-deceived by a superficial\\nexamination--certain alloys resemble the “noble metals”--or deliberately\\ncheated by impostors, is of course undoubted. But at the same time we\\nmust not assume that, because we know not the method now, real\\ntransmutations have never taken place. Modern research indicates that it\\nmay be possible to transmute other metals, such as lead or bismuth, into\\ngold, and consequently we must admit the possibility that amongst the\\nmany experiments carried out, a real transmutation was effected. On the\\nother hand, the method which is suggested by the recent researches in\\nquestion could not have been known to the alchemists or accidentally\\nemployed by them; and, moreover, the quantity of gold which is hoped\\nfor, should such a method prove successful, is far below the smallest\\namount that would have been detected in the days of Alchemy. But if\\nthere be one method whereby the metals may be transmuted, there may be\\nother methods. And it is not altogether an easy task to explain away the\\ntestimony of eminent men such as were van Helmont and Helvetius.\\n\\n\\nThe Testimony of van Helmont.\\n\\n§ =62.= =John Baptist van Helmont= (see § 57), who was celebrated alike\\nfor his skill as a physician and chemist and for his nobility of\\ncharacter, testified in more than one place that he had himself carried\\nout the transmutation of mercury into gold. But, as we have mentioned\\nabove, the composition of the Stone employed on these occasions was\\nunknown to him. He says: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. For truly, I have divers times seen it\\n[the Stone of the Philosophers], and handled it with my hands: but it\\nwas of colour, such as is in Saffron in its Powder, yet weighty, and\\nshining like unto powdered Glass: There was once given unto me one\\nfourth part of one Grain: But I call a Grain the six hundredth part of\\none Ounce: This quarter of one Grain therefore, being rouled up in\\nPaper, I projected upon eight Ounces of Quick-silver made hot in a\\nCrucible; and straightway all the Quick-silver, with a certain degree of\\nNoise, stood still from flowing, and being congealed, setled like unto a\\nyellow Lump: but after pouring it out, the Bellows blowing, there were\\nfound eight Ounces, and a little less than eleven Grains [eight Ounces\\nless eleven Grains] of the purest Gold: Therefore one only Grain of that\\nPowder, had transchanged 19186 [19156] Parts of Quick-silver, equal to\\nitself, into the best Gold.”[85]\\n\\n    [85] J. B. VAN HELMONT: _Life Eternal_ (see _Oriatrike_, translated\\n    by J. C., 1662; or _van Helmont’s Workes_, translated by J. C.,\\n    1664, which is merely the former work with a new title-page and\\n    preliminary matter, pp. 751 and 752).\\n\\nAnd again: “I am constrained to believe that there is the Stone which\\nmakes Gold, and which makes Silver; because I have at distinct turns,\\nmade projection with my hand, of one grain of the Powder, upon some\\nthousand grains of hot Quick-silver; and the buisiness succeeded in the\\nFire, even as Books do promise; a Circle of many People standing by,\\ntogether with a tickling Admiration of us all. .\\xa0.\\xa0. He who first gave\\nme the Gold-making Powder, had likewise also, at least as much of it, as\\nmight be sufficient for changing two hundred thousand Pounds of Gold:\\n.\\xa0.\\xa0. For he gave me perhaps half a grain of that Powder, and nine\\nounces and three quarters of Quick-silver were thereby transchanged: But\\nthat Gold, a strange man [a stranger], being a Friend of one evenings\\nacquaintance, gave me.”[86]\\n\\n    [86] J. B. VAN HELMONT: _The Tree of Life_ (see _Oriatrike_ or _Van\\n    Helmont’s Workes_, p. 807).\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 13.\\n\\n_To face page 84_]]\\n\\n\\nThe Testimony of Helvetius.\\n\\n§ =63.= =John Frederick Helvetius= (see plate 13), an eminent doctor of\\nmedicine, and physician to the Prince of Orange, published at the Hague\\nin 1667 the following remarkable account of a transmutation he claimed\\nto have effected. Certain points of resemblance between this account and\\nthat of van Helmont (_e.g._, in each case the Stone is described as a\\nglassy substance of a pale yellow colour) are worth noticing: “On the 27\\nDecember, 1666, in the forenoon, there came to my house a certain man,\\nwho was a complete stranger to me, but of an honest, grave countenance,\\nand an authoritative mien, clothed in a simple garb like that of a\\nMemnonite. .\\xa0.\\xa0.\\n\\n“After we had exchanged salutations, he asked me whether he might have\\nsome conversation with me. He wished to say something to me about the\\nPyrotechnic Art, as he had read one of my tracts (directed against the\\nsympathetic Powder of Dr. Digby), in which I hinted a suspicion whether\\nthe Grand Arcanum of the Sages was not after all a gigantic hoax. He,\\ntherefore, took that opportunity of asking me whether I could not\\nbelieve that such a grand mystery might exist in the nature of things,\\nby means of which a physician could restore any patient whose vitals\\nwere not irreparably destroyed. I answered: ‘Such a Medicine would be a\\nmost desirable acquisition for any physician; nor can any man tell how\\nmany secrets there may be hidden in Nature; yet, though I have read much\\nabout the truth of this Art, it has never been my good fortune to meet\\nwith a real Master of the Alchemical Science.’ I also enquired whether\\nhe was a medical man. .\\xa0.\\xa0. In reply, he .\\xa0.\\xa0. described himself as a\\nbrassfounder. .\\xa0.\\xa0. After some further conversation, the Artist Elias\\n(for it was he) thus addressed me: ‘Since you have read so much in the\\nworks of the Alchemists about this Stone, its substance, its colour, and\\nits wonderful effects, may I be allowed the question, whether you have\\nnot yourself prepared it?’ On my answering his question in the negative,\\nhe took out of his bag a cunningly-worked ivory box, in which there were\\nthree large pieces of a substance resembling glass, or pale sulphur, and\\ninformed me that here was enough of the Tincture for the production of\\n20 tons of gold. When I had held the precious treasure in my hand for\\na quarter of an hour (during which time I listened to a recital of its\\nwonderful curative properties), I was compelled to restore it to its\\nowner, which I could not help doing with a certain degree of reluctance.\\nAfter thanking him for his kindness in shewing it to me, I then asked\\nhow it was that his Stone did not display that ruby colour, which I had\\nbeen taught to regard as characteristic of the Philosopher’s Stone. He\\nreplied that the colour made no difference, and that the substance was\\nsufficiently mature for all practical purposes. My request that he would\\ngive me a piece of his Stone (though it were no larger than a coriander\\nseed), he somewhat brusquely refused, adding, in a milder tone, that he\\ncould not give it me for all the wealth I possessed, and that not on\\naccount of its great preciousness, but for some other reason which it\\nwas not lawful for him to divulge; .\\xa0.\\xa0.\\n\\n\\nHelvetius obtains the Philosopher’s Stone.\\n\\n§ =64.= “When my strange visitor had concluded his narrative, I besought\\nhim to give me a proof of his assertion, by performing the transmutatory\\noperation on some metals in my presence. He answered evasively, that he\\ncould not do so then, but that he would return in three weeks, and that,\\nif he was then at liberty to do so, he would shew me something that\\nwould make me open my eyes. He appeared punctually to the promised day,\\nand invited me to take a walk with him, in the course of which we\\ndiscoursed profoundly on the secrets of Nature in fire, though I noticed\\nthat my companion was very chary in imparting information about the\\nGrand Arcanum. .\\xa0.\\xa0. At last I asked him point-blank to show me the\\ntransmutation of metals. I besought him to come and dine with me, and to\\nspend the night at my house; I entreated; I expostulated; but in vain.\\nHe remained firm. I reminded him of his promise. He retorted that his\\npromise had been conditional upon his being permitted to reveal the\\nsecret to me. At last, however, I prevailed upon him to give me a piece\\nof his precious Stone--a piece no larger than a grain of rape seed. He\\ndelivered it to me as if it were the most princely donation in the\\nworld. Upon my uttering a doubt whether it would be sufficient to tinge\\nmore than four grains of lead, he eagerly demanded it back. I complied,\\nin the hope that he would exchange it for a larger piece; instead of\\nwhich he divided it in two with his thumb, threw away one-half and gave\\nme back the other, saying: ‘Even now it is sufficient for you.’ Then I\\nwas still more heavily disappointed, as I could not believe that\\nanything could be done with so small a particle of the Medicine. He,\\nhowever, bade me take two drachms, or half an ounce of lead, or even a\\nlittle more, and to melt it in the crucible; for the Medicine would\\ncertainly not tinge more of the base metal than it was sufficient for. I\\nanswered that I could not believe that so small a quantity of Tincture\\ncould transform so large a mass of lead. But I had to be satisfied with\\nwhat he had given me, and my chief difficulty was about the application\\nof the Tincture. I confessed that when I held his ivory box in my hand,\\nI had managed to extract a few crumbs of his Stone, but that they had\\nchanged my lead, not into gold, but only into glass. He laughed, and\\nsaid that I was more expert at theft than at the application of the\\nTincture. ‘You should have protected your spoil with “yellow wax,” then\\nit would have been able to penetrate the lead and to transmute it into\\ngold.’ .\\xa0.\\xa0.\\n\\n\\nHelvetius performs a Transmutation.\\n\\n§ =65.= “.\\xa0.\\xa0. With .\\xa0.\\xa0. a promise to return at nine o’clock the next\\nmorning, he left me. But at the stated hour on the following day he did\\nnot make his appearance; in his stead, however, there came, a few hours\\nlater, a stranger, who told me that his friend the Artist was\\nunavoidably detained, but that he would call at three o’clock in the\\nafternoon. The afternoon came; I waited for him till half-past seven\\no’clock. He did not appear. Thereupon my wife came and tempted me to try\\nthe transmutation myself. I determined, however, to wait till the\\nmorrow, and in the meantime, ordered my son to light the fire, as I was\\nnow almost sure that he was an impostor. On the morrow, however, I\\nthought that I might at least make an experiment with the piece of\\n‘Tincture’ which I had received; if it turned out a failure, in spite of\\nmy following his directions closely, I might then be quite certain that\\nmy visitor had been a mere pretender to a knowledge of this Art. So I\\nasked my wife to put the Tincture in wax, and I myself, in the meantime,\\nprepared six drachms of lead; I then cast the Tincture, enveloped as it\\nwas in wax, on the lead; as soon as it was melted, there was a hissing\\nsound and a slight effervescence, and after a quarter of an hour I found\\nthat the whole mass of lead had been turned into the finest gold. Before\\nthis transmutation took place, the compound became intensely green, but\\nas soon as I had poured it into the melting pot it assumed a hue like\\nblood. When it cooled, it glittered and shone like gold. We immediately\\ntook it to the goldsmith, who at once declared it to be the finest gold\\nhe had ever seen, and offered to pay fifty florins an ounce for it.\\n\\n\\nHelvetius’s Gold Assayed.\\n\\n§ =66.= “The rumour, of course, spread at once like wildfire through the\\nwhole city; and in the afternoon, I had visits from many illustrious\\nstudents of this Art; I also received a call from the Master of the Mint\\nand some other gentlemen, who requested me to place at their disposal a\\nsmall piece of the gold, in order that they might subject it to the\\nusual tests. I consented, and we betook ourselves to the house of a\\ncertain silversmith, named Brechtil, who submitted a small piece of my\\ngold to the test called ‘the fourth’: three or four parts of silver are\\nmelted in the crucible with one part of gold, and then beaten out into\\nthin plates, upon which some strong _aqua fortis_ [nitric acid] is\\npoured. The usual result of this experiment is that the silver is\\ndissolved, while the gold sinks to the bottom in the shape of a black\\npowder, and after the _aqua fortis_ has been poured off, [the gold,]\\nmelted once again in the crucible, resumes its former shape. .\\xa0.\\xa0. When\\nwe now performed this experiment, we thought at first that one-half of\\nthe gold had evaporated; but afterwards we found that this was not the\\ncase, but that, on the contrary, two scruples of the silver had\\nundergone a change into gold.\\n\\n\\nHelvetius’s Gold Further Tested.\\n\\n§ =67.= “Then we tried another test, _viz._, that which is performed by\\nmeans of a septuple of Antimony; at first it seemed as if eight grains\\nof the gold had been lost, but afterwards, not only had two scruples of\\nthe silver been converted into gold, but the silver itself was greatly\\nimproved both in quality and malleability. Thrice I performed this\\ninfallible test, discovering that every drachm of gold produced an\\nincrease of a scruple of gold, but the silver is excellent and extremely\\nflexible. Thus I have unfolded to you the whole story from beginning to\\nend. The gold I still retain in my possession, but I cannot tell you\\nwhat has become of the Artist Elias. Before he left me, on the last day\\nof our friendly intercourse, he told me that he was on the point of\\nundertaking a journey to the Holy Land. May the Holy Angels of God watch\\nover him wherever he is, and long preserve him as a source of blessing\\nto Christendom! This is my earnest prayer on his and our behalf.”[87]\\n\\n    [87] J. F. HELVETIUS: _The Golden Calf_, ch. iii. (see _The Hermetic\\n    Museum_, vol. ii. pp. 283 _et seq._).\\n\\nTestimony such as this warns us not to be too sure that a real\\ntransmutation has never taken place. On the whole, with regard to this\\nquestion, an agnostic position appears to be the more philosophical.\\n\\n\\nThe Genesis of Chemistry.\\n\\n§ =68.= But even if the alchemists did not discover the Grand Arcanum of\\nNature, they did discover very many scientifically important facts. Even\\nif they did not prepare the Philosopher’s Stone, they did prepare a very\\nlarge number of new and important chemical compounds. Their labours were\\nthe seeds out of which modern Chemistry developed, and this highly\\nimportant science is rightfully included under the expression “The\\nOutcome of Alchemy.” As we have already pointed out (§ 48), it was the\\niatro-chemists who first investigated chemical matters with an object\\nother than alchemistic, their especial end in view being the\\npreparation of useful medicines, though the medical-chemist and the\\nalchemist were very often united in the one person, as in the case of\\nParacelsus himself and the not less famous van Helmont. It was not until\\nstill later that Chemistry was recognised as a distinct science separate\\nfrom medicine.\\n\\n\\nThe Degeneracy of Alchemy.\\n\\n§ =69.= In another direction the Outcome of Alchemy was of a very\\ndistressing nature. Alchemy was in many respects eminently suitable as a\\ncloak for fraud, and those who became “alchemists” with the sole object\\nof accumulating much wealth in a short space of time, finding that the\\nlegitimate pursuit of the Art did not enable them to realise their\\nexpectations in this direction, availed themselves of this fact. There\\nis, indeed, some evidence that the degeneracy of Alchemy had commenced\\nas early as the fourteenth century, but the attainment of the _magnum\\nopus_ was regarded as possible for some three or more centuries.\\n\\nThe alchemistic promises of health, wealth and happiness and a\\npseudo-mystical style of language were effectively employed by these\\nimpostors. Some more or less ingenious tricks--such as the use of hollow\\nstirring-rods, in which the gold was concealed, &c.--convinced a\\ncredulous public of the validity of their claims. Of these\\npseudo-alchemists we have already made the acquaintance of Edward\\nKelley, but chief of them all is generally accounted the notorious\\n“Count Cagliostro.” That “Cagliostro” is rightfully placed in the\\ncategory of pseudo-alchemists is certain, but it also appears equally\\ncertain that, charlatan though he was, posterity has not always done\\nhim that justice which is due to all men, however bad they may be.\\n\\n\\n“Count Cagliostro” (--?-1795).\\n\\n§ =70.= Of the birth and early life of the personage calling himself\\n“=Count Cagliostro=” nothing is known with any degree of certainty, even\\nhis true name being enveloped in mystery. It has, indeed, been usual to\\nidentify him with the notorious Italian swindler, Giuseppe Balsamo, who,\\nborn at Palermo in 1743 (or 1748), apparently disappeared from mortal\\nken after some thirty years, of which the majority were spent in\\ncommitting various crimes. “Cagliostro’s” latest biographer,[88] who\\nappears to have gone into the matter very thoroughly, however, throws\\nvery grave doubts on the truth of this theory.\\n\\n    [88] W. R. H. TROWBRIDGE: _Cagliostro_: _The Splendour and Misery of\\n    a Master of Magic_ (1910). We must acknowledge our indebtedness for\\n    many of the particulars which follow to this work. It is, however,\\n    unfortunately marred by a ridiculous attempt to show a likeness\\n    between “Cagliostro” and Swedenborg, for which, by the way, Mr.\\n    Trowbridge has already been criticised by the _Spectator_. It may\\n    justly be said of Swedenborg that he was scrupulously honest and\\n    sincere in his beliefs as well as in his actions; and, as a\\n    philosopher, it is only now being discovered how really great he\\n    was. He did, indeed, claim to have converse with spiritual beings;\\n    but the results of modern psychical research have robbed such claims\\n    of any inherent impossibility, and in Swedenborg’s case there is\\n    very considerable evidence for their validity.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 14.\\n\\n_To face page 92_]]\\n\\nIf the earlier part of “Cagliostro’s” life is unknown, the latter part\\nis so overlaid with legends and lies, that it is almost impossible to\\nget at the truth concerning it. In 1776 Cagliostro and his wife were in\\nLondon, where “Cagliostro” became a Freemason, joining a lodge connected\\nwith “The Order of Strict Observance,” a secret society incorporated\\nwith Freemasonry, and which (on the Continent, at least) was concerned\\nlargely with occult subjects. “Cagliostro,” however, was unsatisfied\\nwith its rituals and devised a new system which he called Egyptian\\nMasonry. Egyptian Masonry, he taught, was to reform the whole world, and\\nhe set out, leaving England for the Continent, to convert Masons and\\nothers to his views. We must look for the motive power of his\\nextraordinary career in vanity and a love of mystery-mongering, without\\nany true knowledge of the occult; it is probable, indeed, that\\nultimately his unbounded vanity triumphed over his reason and that he\\nactually believed in his own pretensions. That he did possess hypnotic\\nand clairvoyant powers is, we think, at least probable; but it is none\\nthe less certain that, when such failed him, he had no scruples against\\nemploying other means of convincing the credulous of the validity of his\\nclaims. This was the case on his visit to Russia, which occurred not\\nlong afterwards. At St. Petersburg a youthful medium he was employing,\\nto put the matter briefly, “gave the show away,” and at Warsaw, where he\\nfound it necessary to turn alchemist, he was detected in the process of\\nintroducing a piece of gold in the crucible containing the base metal he\\nwas about to “transmute.” At Strasburg, which he reached in 1780,\\nhowever, he was more successful. Here he appeared as a miraculous healer\\nof all diseases, though whether his cures are to be ascribed to some\\nsimple but efficacious medicine which he had discovered, to hypnotism,\\nto the power of the imagination on the part of his patients, or to the\\npower of imagination on the part of those who have recorded the alleged\\ncures, is a question into which we do not propose to enter. At\\nStrasburg “Cagliostro” came into contact with the Cardinal de Rohan, and\\na fast friendship sprang up between the two, which, in the end, proved\\n“Cagliostro’s” ruin. The “Count” next visited Bordeaux and Lyons,\\nsuccessfully founding lodges of Egyptian Masonry. From the latter town\\nhe proceeded to Paris, where he reached the height of his fame. He\\nbecame extraordinarily rich, although he is said to have asked, and to\\nhave accepted, no fee for his services as a healer. On the other hand,\\nthere was a substantial entrance-fee to the mysteries of Egyptian\\nMasonry, which, with its alchemistic promises of health and wealth,\\nprospered exceedingly. At the summit of his career, however, fortune\\nforsook him. As a friend of de Rohan, he was arrested in connection with\\nthe Diamond Necklace affair, on the word of the infamous Countess de\\nLamotte; although, of whatever else he may have been guilty, he was\\nperfectly innocent of this charge. After lying imprisoned in the\\nBastille for several months, he was tried by the French Parliament,\\npronounced innocent, and released. Immediately, however, the king\\nbanished him, and he left Paris for London, where he seems to have been\\npersistently persecuted by agents of the French king. He returned to the\\nContinent, ultimately reaching Italy, where he was arrested by the\\nInquisition and condemned to death on the charge of being a Freemason (a\\ndire offence in the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church). The sentence,\\nhowever, was modified to one of perpetual imprisonment, and he was\\nconfined in the Castle of San Leo, where he died in 1795, after four\\nyears of imprisonment, in what manner is not known.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nTHE AGE OF MODERN CHEMISTRY\\n\\n\\nThe Birth of Modern Chemistry.\\n\\n§ =71.= Chemistry as distinct from Alchemy and Iatro-chemistry commenced\\nwith Robert Boyle (see plate 15), who first clearly recognised that its\\naim is neither the transmutation of the metals nor the preparation of\\nmedicines, but the observation and generalisation of a certain class of\\nphenomena; who denied the validity of the alchemistic view of the\\nconstitution of matter, and enunciated the definition of an element\\nwhich has since reigned supreme in Chemistry; and who enriched the\\nscience with observations of the utmost importance. Boyle, however, was\\na man whose ideas were in advance of his times, and intervening between\\nthe iatro-chemical period and the Age of Modern Chemistry proper came\\nthe period of the Phlogistic Theory--a theory which had a certain\\naffinity with the ideas of the alchemists.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 15.\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF ROBERT BOYLE.\\n\\n_To face page 94_]]\\n\\n\\nThe Phlogiston Theory.\\n\\n§ =72.= The phlogiston theory was mainly due to Georg Ernst Stahl\\n(1660-1734). Becher (1635-1682) had attempted to revive the once\\nuniversally accepted sulphur-mercury-salt theory of the alchemists in a\\nsomewhat modified form, by the assumption that all substances consist of\\nthree earths--the combustible, mercurial, and vitreous; and herein is\\nto be found the germ of Stahl’s phlogistic theory. According to Stahl,\\nall combustible bodies (including those metals that change on heating)\\ncontain _phlogiston_, the principle of combustion, which escapes in the\\nform of flame when such substances are burned. According to this theory,\\ntherefore, the metals are compounds, since they consist of a metallic\\ncalx (what we now call the “oxide” of the metal) combined with\\nphlogiston; and, further, to obtain the metal from the calx it is only\\nnecessary to act upon it with some substance rich in phlogiston. Now,\\ncoal and charcoal are both almost completely combustible, leaving very\\nlittle residue; hence, according to this theory, they must consist very\\nlargely of phlogiston; and, as a matter of fact, metals can be obtained\\nby heating their calces with either of these substances. Many other\\nfacts of a like nature were explicable in terms of the phlogiston\\ntheory, and it became exceedingly popular. Chemists at this time did not\\npay much attention to the balance; it was observed, however, that metals\\nincreased in weight on calcination, but this was “explained” on the\\nassumption that phlogiston possessed negative weight. Antoine Lavoisier\\n(1743-1794), utilising Priestley’s discovery of oxygen (called\\n“dephlogisticated air” by its discoverer) and studying the weight\\nrelations accompanying combustion, demonstrated the non-validity of the\\nphlogistic theory[89] and proved combustion to be the combination of the\\nsubstance burnt with a certain constituent of the air, the oxygen. By\\nthis time Alchemy was to all intents and purposes defunct, Boerhave\\n(1668-1738) was the last eminent chemist to give any support to its\\ndoctrines, and the new chemistry of Lavoisier gave it a final\\ndeath-blow. We now enter upon the Age of Modern Chemistry, but we shall\\ndeal in this chapter with the history of chemical theory only so far as\\nis necessary in pursuance of our primary object, and hence our account\\nwill be very far from complete.\\n\\n    [89] It should be noted, however, that if by the term “phlogiston”\\n    we were to understand energy and not some form of matter, most of\\n    the statements of the phlogistics would be true so far as they go.\\n\\n\\nBoyle and the Definition of an Element.\\n\\n§ =73.= Robert Boyle (1626-1691) had defined an element as a substance\\nwhich could not be decomposed, but which could enter into combination\\nwith other elements giving compounds capable of decomposition into these\\noriginal elements. Hence, the metals were classed among the elements,\\nsince they had defied all attempts to decompose them. Now, it must be\\nnoted that this definition is of a negative character, and, although it\\nis convenient to term “elements” all substances which have so far defied\\ndecomposition, it is a matter of impossibility to decide what substances\\nare true elements with absolute certainty; and the possibility, however\\nfaint, that gold and other metals are of a compound nature, and hence\\nthe possibility of preparing gold from the “base” metals or other\\nsubstances, must always remain. This uncertainty regarding the elements\\nappears to have generally been recognised by the new school of chemists,\\nbut this having been so, it is the more surprising that their criticism\\nof alchemistic art was not less severe.\\n\\n\\nThe Stoichiometric Laws.\\n\\n§ =74.= With the study of the relative weights in which substances\\ncombine, certain generalisations or “natural laws” of supreme importance\\nwere discovered. These stoichiometric laws, as they are called, are as\\nfollows:--\\n\\n1. “The Law of Constant Proportion”--_The same chemical compound always\\ncontains the same elements, and there is a constant ratio between the\\nweights of the constituent elements present._\\n\\n2. “The Law of Multiple Proportions”--_If two substances combine\\nchemically in more than one proportion, the weights of the one which\\ncombine with a given weight of the other, stand in a simple rational\\nratio to one another._\\n\\n3. “The Law of Combining Weights”--_Substances combine either in the\\nratio of their combining numbers, or in simple rational multiples or\\nsubmultiples of these numbers._ (The weights of different substances\\nwhich combine with a given weight of some particular substance, which is\\ntaken as the unit, are called the combining numbers of such substances\\nwith reference to this unit. The usual unit now chosen is 8 grammes of\\nOxygen.)[90]\\n\\n    [90] In order that these laws may hold good, it is, of course,\\n    necessary that the substances are weighed under precisely similar\\n    conditions. To state these laws in a more absolute form, we can\\n    replace the term “weight” by “mass,” or in preference, “inertia”;\\n    for the inertias of bodies are proportional to their weights,\\n    providing that they are weighed under precisely similar conditions.\\n    For a discussion of the exact significance of these terms “mass” and\\n    “inertia,” the reader is referred to the present writer’s _Matter,\\n    Spirit and the Cosmos_ (Rider, 1910), Chapter I., “On the Doctrine\\n    of the Indestructibility of Matter.”\\n\\nAs examples of these laws we may take the few following simple facts:--\\n\\n1. Pure water is found always to consist of oxygen and hydrogen combined\\nin the ratio of 1·008 parts by weight of the latter to 8 parts by weight\\nof the former; and pure sulphur-dioxide, to take another example, is\\nfound always to consist of sulphur and oxygen combined in the ratio of\\n8·02 parts by weight of sulphur to 8 parts by weight of oxygen. (The Law\\nof Constant Proportion.)\\n\\n2. Another compound is known consisting only of oxygen and hydrogen,\\nwhich, however, differs entirely in its properties from water. It is\\nfound always to consist of oxygen and hydrogen combined in the ratio of\\n1·008 parts by weight of the latter to 16 parts by weight of the former,\\n_i.e._, in it a definite weight of hydrogen is combined with an amount\\nof oxygen _exactly twice_ that which is combined with the same weight of\\nhydrogen in water. No definite compound has been discovered with a\\nconstitution intermediate between these two. Other compounds consisting\\nonly of sulphur and oxygen are also known. One of these (viz.,\\nsulphur-trioxide, or sulphuric anhydride) is found always to consist of\\nsulphur and oxygen combined in the ratio of 5·35 parts by weight of\\nsulphur to 8 parts by weight of oxygen. We see, therefore, that the\\nweights of sulphur combined with a definite weight of oxygen in the two\\ncompounds called respectively “sulphur-dioxide” and “sulphur-trioxide,”\\nare in the proportion of 8·02 to 5·35, _i.e._, 3\\xa0:\\xa02. Similar simple\\nratios are obtained in the case of all the other compounds. (The Law of\\nMultiple Proportions.)\\n\\n3. From the data given in (1) above we can fix the combining number of\\nhydrogen as 1·008, that of sulphur as 8·02. Now, compounds are known\\ncontaining sulphur and hydrogen, and, in each case, the weight of\\nsulphur combined with 1·008 grammes of hydrogen is found always to be\\neither 8·02 grammes or some multiple or submultiple of this quantity.\\nThus, in the simplest compound of this sort, containing only hydrogen\\nand sulphur (viz., sulphuretted-hydrogen or hydrogen sulphide), 1·008\\ngrammes of hydrogen is found always to be combined with 16·04 grammes of\\nsulphur, _i.e._, exactly twice the above quantity. (The Law of Combining\\nWeights.)\\n\\nBerthollet (1748-1822) denied the truth of the law of constant\\nproportion, and a controversy ensued between this chemist and Proust\\n(1755-1826), who undertook a research to settle the question, the\\nresults of which were in entire agreement with the law, and were\\nregarded as completely substantiating it.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 16.\\n\\n[by Worthington, after Allen]\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF JOHN DALTON.\\n\\n_To face page 100_]]\\n\\n\\nDalton’s Atomic Theory.\\n\\n§ =75.= At the beginning of the nineteenth century, John Dalton (see\\nplate 15) put forward his Atomic Theory in explanation of these facts.\\nThis theory assumes (1) that all matter is made up of small indivisible\\nand indestructible particles, called “atoms”; (2) that all atoms are\\n_not_ alike, there being as many different sorts of atoms as there are\\nelements; (3) that the atoms constituting any one element are exactly\\nalike and are of definite weight; and (4) that compounds are produced by\\nthe combination of different atoms. Now, it is at once evident that if\\nmatter be so constituted, the stoichiometric laws must necessarily\\nfollow. For the smallest particle of any definite compound (now called a\\n“molecule”) must consist of a definite assemblage of different atoms,\\nand these atoms are of definite weight: whence the law of constant\\nproportion. One atom of one substance may combine with 1, 2, 3 .\\xa0.\\xa0.\\natoms of some other substance, but it cannot combine with some\\nfractional part of an atom, since the atoms are indivisible: whence the\\nlaw of multiple proportions. And these laws holding good, and the atoms\\nbeing of definite weight, the law of combining weights necessarily\\nfollows. Dalton’s Atomic Theory gave a simple and intelligible\\nexplanation of these remarkable facts regarding the weights of\\nsubstances entering into chemical combination, and, therefore, gained\\nuniversal acceptance. But throughout the history of Chemistry can be\\ndiscerned a spirit of revolt against it as an explanation of the\\nabsolute constitution of matter. The tendency of scientific philosophy\\nhas always been towards Monism as opposed to Dualism, and here were not\\nmerely two eternals, but several dozen; Dalton’s theory denied the unity\\nof the Cosmos, it lacked the unifying principle of the alchemists. It is\\nonly in recent times that it has been recognised that a scientific\\nhypothesis may be very useful without being altogether true. As to the\\nusefulness of Dalton’s theory there can be no question; it has\\naccomplished that which no other hypothesis could have done; it rendered\\nthe concepts of a chemical element, a chemical compound and a chemical\\nreaction definite; and has, in a sense, led to the majority of the\\ndiscoveries in the domain of Chemistry that have been made since its\\nenunciation. But as an expression of absolute truth, Dalton’s theory, as\\nis very generally recognised nowadays, fails to be satisfactory. In the\\npast, however, it has been the philosophers of the materialistic school\\nof thought, rather than the chemists _quâ_ chemists, who have\\ninsisted on the absolute truth of the Atomic Theory; Kekulé, who by\\ndeveloping Franklin’s theory of atomicity or valency[91] made still more\\ndefinite the atomic view of matter, himself expressed grave doubts as to\\nthe absolute truth of Dalton’s theory; but he regarded it as\\n_chemically_ true, and thus voices what appears to be the opinion of the\\nmajority of chemists nowadays, namely, there are such things as chemical\\natoms and chemical elements, incapable of being decomposed by purely\\nchemical means, but that such are not absolute atoms or absolute\\nelements, and consequently not impervious to all forms of action. But\\nof this more will be said later.\\n\\n    [91] The term “valency” is not altogether an easy one to define; we\\n    will, however, here do our best to make plain its significance. In a\\n    definite chemical compound we must assume that the atoms\\n    constituting each molecule are in some way bound together (though\\n    not, of course, rigidly), and we may speak of “bonds” or “links of\\n    affinity,” taking care, however, not to interpret such terms too\\n    literally. Now, the number of “affinity links” which one atom can\\n    exert is not unlimited; indeed, according to the valency theory as\\n    first formulated, it is fixed and constant. It is this number which\\n    is called the “valency” of the element; but it is now known that the\\n    “valency” in most cases can vary between certain limits. Hydrogen,\\n    however, appears to be invariably univalent, and is therefore taken\\n    as the unit of valency. Thus, Carbon is quadrivalent in the\\n    methane-molecule, which consists of one atom of carbon combined\\n    with four atoms of hydrogen; and Oxygen is divalent in the\\n    water-molecule, which consists of one atom of oxygen combined with\\n    two atoms of hydrogen. Hence, we should expect to find one atom of\\n    carbon combining with two of oxygen, which is the case in the\\n    carbon-dioxide--(carbonic anhydride)--molecule. For a development of\\n    the thesis, so far as the compounds of carbon are concerned, that\\n    each specific “affinity link” corresponds in general to a definite\\n    and constant amount of energy, which is evolved as heat on\\n    disruption of the bond, the reader is referred to the present\\n    writer’s monograph _On the Calculation of Thermo-Chemical Constants_\\n    (Arnold, 1909). The phenomena of valency find their explanation in\\n    modern views concerning the constitution of atoms (see § 81).\\n\\n\\nThe Determination of the Atomic Weights of the Elements.\\n\\n§ =76.= With the acceptance of Dalton’s Atomic Theory, it became\\nnecessary to determine the atomic weights of the various elements,\\n_i.e._, not the absolute atomic weights, but the relative weights of the\\nvarious atoms with reference to one of them as unit.[92] We cannot in\\nthis place enter upon a discussion of the various difficulties, both of\\nan experimental and theoretical nature, which were involved in this\\nproblem, save to remark that the correct atomic weights could be arrived\\nat only with the acceptance of Avogadro’s Hypothesis. This hypothesis,\\nwhich is to the effect that equal volumes of different gases measured at\\nthe same temperature and pressure contain an equal number of gaseous\\nmolecules, was put forward in explanation of a number of facts connected\\nwith the physical behaviour of gases; but its importance was for some\\ntime unrecognised, owing to the fact that the distinction between atoms\\nand molecules was not yet clearly drawn. A list of those chemical\\nsubstances at present recognised as “elements,” together with their\\natomic weights, will be found on pp. 106, 107.\\n\\n    [92] Since hydrogen is the lightest of all known substances, the\\n    unit, Hydrogen = 1, was at one time usually employed. However, it\\n    was seen to be more convenient to express the atomic weights in\\n    terms of the weight of the oxygen-atom, and the unit, Oxygen = 16 is\\n    now always employed. This value for the oxygen-atom was chosen so\\n    that the approximate atomic weights would in most cases remain\\n    unaltered by the change.\\n\\n\\nProut’s Hypothesis.\\n\\n§ =77.= It was observed by a chemist of the name of Prout, that, the\\natomic weight of hydrogen being taken as the unit, the atomic weights\\nof nearly all the elements approximated to whole numbers; and in 1815 he\\nsuggested as the reason for this regularity, that all the elements\\nconsist solely of hydrogen. Prout’s Hypothesis received on the whole a\\nvery favourable reception; it harmonised Dalton’s Theory with the grand\\nconcept of the unity of matter--all matter was hydrogen in essence; and\\nThomas Thomson undertook a research to demonstrate its truth. On the\\nother hand, however, the eminent Swedish chemist, Berzelius, who had\\ncarried out many atomic weight determinations, criticised both Prout’s\\nHypothesis and Thomson’s research (which latter, it is true, was\\nworthless) in most severe terms; for the hypothesis amounted to\\nthis--that the decimals in the atomic weights obtained experimentally by\\nBerzelius, after so much labour, were to be regarded as so many errors.\\nIn 1844, Marignac suggested half the hydrogen atom as the unit, for the\\nelement chlorine, with an atomic weight of 35·5, would not fit in with\\nProut’s Hypothesis as originally formulated; and later, Dumas suggested\\none-quarter. With this theoretical division of the hydrogen-atom, the\\nhypothesis lost its simplicity and charm, and was doomed to downfall.\\nRecent and most accurate atomic weight determinations show clearly that\\nthe atomic weights are not exactly whole numbers, but that,\\nnevertheless, the majority of them (if expressed in terms of O = 16 as\\nthe unit) do approximate very closely to such. The Hon. R. J. Strutt has\\nrecently calculated that the probability of this occurring, in the case\\nof certain of the commoner elements, by mere chance is exceedingly small\\n(about 1 in 1,000),[93] and several attempts to explain this remarkable\\nfact have been put forward. Modern scientific speculations concerning\\nthe constitution of atoms tend towards a modified form of Prout’s\\nhypothesis, or to the view that the atoms of other elements are, in a\\nmanner, polymerides of hydrogen and helium atoms. As has been pointed\\nout, it is possible, according to modern views, for elements of\\ndifferent atomic weight to have identical chemical properties, since\\nthese latter depend only upon the number of free electrons in the atom\\nand not at all upon the massive central nucleus. By a method somewhat\\nsimilar to that used for determining the mass of kathode particles (see\\n§ 79), but applied to positively charged particles, Sir Joseph Thomson\\nand Dr. F. W. Aston discovered that the element neon was a mixture of\\ntwo isotopic elements in unequal proportions, one having an atomic mass\\nof 20, the other (present only to a slight extent) having an atomic mass\\nof 22. Dr. Aston has perfected this method of analysing mixtures of\\nisotopes and determining their atomic masses.[94] The results are of\\ngreat interest. The atomic weight of hydrogen, 1·008, is confirmed. The\\nelements helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, phosphorus,\\nsulphur, arsenic, iodine and sodium are found to be simple bodies with\\nwhole-number atomic weights. On the other hand, boron, neon, silicon,\\nchlorine, bromine, krypton, xenon, mercury, lithium, potassium and\\nrubidium are found to be mixtures. What is specially of interest is that\\nthe indicated atomic mass of each of the constituents is a whole number.\\nThus chlorine, whose atomic weight is 35·46, is found to be a mixture of\\ntwo chemically-identical elements whose atomic weights are 35 and 37.\\nSome of the elements, _e.g._, xenon, are mixtures of more than two\\nisotopes.\\n\\n    [93] Hon. R. J. STRUTT: “On the Tendency of the Atomic Weights to\\n    approximate to Whole Numbers,” _Philosophical Magazine_, [6], vol.\\n    i. (1901), pp. 311 _et seq._\\n\\n    [94] F. W. ASTON: “Mass-spectra and Atomic Weights,” _Journal of the\\n    Chemical Society_, vol. cix. (1921), pp. 677 _et seq._\\n\\nIt is highly probable that what is true of the elements investigated by\\nDr. Aston is true of the remainder. It appears, therefore, that the\\nirregularities presented by the atomic weights of the ordinary elements,\\nwhich have so much puzzled men of science in the past, are due to the\\nfact that these elements are, in many cases, mixtures. As concerns\\nhydrogen, it is only reasonable to suppose that the close packing of\\nelectrically charged particles should give rise to a slight decrease in\\ntheir total mass, so that the atomic weights of other elements referred\\nto H = 1 should be slightly less than whole numbers, or, what is the\\nsame thing, that the atomic weight of hydrogen referred to O = 16 should\\nbe slightly more than unity.\\n\\n\\nThe “Periodic Law.”\\n\\n§ =78.= A remarkable property of the atomic weights was discovered, in\\nthe sixties, independently by Lothar Meyer and Mendeléeff. They found\\nthat the elements could be arranged in rows in the order of their atomic\\nweights so that similar elements would be found in the same columns. A\\nmodernised form of the Periodic Table will be found on pp. 106, 107. It\\nwill be noticed, for example, that the “alkali” metals, Lithium, Sodium,\\nRubidium and Cæsium, which resemble one another very closely, fall in\\nColumn 1; the “alkaline earth” metals occur together in Column 2; though\\nin each case these are accompanied by certain elements with somewhat\\ndifferent properties. Much the same holds good in the case of the other\\ncolumns of this Table; there is manifested a remarkable regularity, with\\ncertain still more remarkable divergences (see notes appended to Table\\non pp. 106, 107). This regularity exhibited by the “elements” is of\\nconsiderable importance, since it shows that, in general, the properties\\nof the “elements” are _periodic_ functions of their atomic weights; and,\\ntogether with certain other remarkable properties of the “elements,”\\ndistinguishes them sharply from the “compounds.” It may be concluded\\nwith tolerable certainty, therefore, that if the “elements” are in\\nreality of a compound nature, they are all, in general, compounds of a\\nlike nature distinct from that of other compounds.\\n\\nTHE PERIODIC TABLE OF THE CHEMICAL ELEMENTS.\\n\\n  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\\n  |   0   |   1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |   5   |   6   |   7   |   8    |\\n  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\\n  |       |[Hydro-|       |       |       |       |       |Hydro- |        |\\n  |       |gen][a]|       |       |       |       |       |gen    |        |\\n  |       |[H =   |       |       |       |       |       |H =    |        |\\n  |       |1·008] |       |       |       |       |       |1·008  |        |\\n  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\\n  |Helium |Lithium|Gluci- |Boron  |Carbon |Nitro- |Oxygen |Fluo-  |        |\\n  |       |       |num    |       |       |gen    |       |rine   |        |\\n  |He =   |Li =   |Gl =   |B =    |C =    |N =    |O =    |F =    |        |\\n  |4·00   |6·94   |9·1    |10·9   |12·005 |14·008 |16·00  |19·0   |        |\\n  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\\n  |Neon   |Sodium |Magne- |Alumin-|Silicon|Phos-  |Sulphur|Chlo-  |        |\\n  |       |       |sium   |ium    |       |phorus |       |rine   |        |\\n  |Ne =   |Na =   |Mg =   |Al =   |Si =   |P =    |S =    |Cl =   |        |\\n  |20·2   |23·00  |24·32  |27·1   |28·3   |31·04  |32·06  |35·46  |        |\\n  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\\n  |Argon  |Potas- |Calcium|Scan-  |Tita-  |Vana-  |Chro-  |Manga- |Iron    |\\n  |       |sium[b]|       |dium   |nium   |dium   |mium   |nese   |Fe =    |\\n  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |55·84[c]|\\n  |A =    |K =    |Ca =   |Sc =   |Ti =   |V =    |Cr =   |Mn =   |Cobalt  |\\n  |39·9   |39·10  |40·07  |45·1   |48·1   |51·0   |52·0   |54·93  |Co =    |\\n  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |58·97   |\\n  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |Nickel  |\\n  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |Ni =    |\\n  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |58·68   |\\n  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\\n  |       |Copper |Zinc   |Gallium|Germa- |Arsenic|Sele-  |Bromine|        |\\n  |       |       |       |       |nium   |       |nium   |       |        |\\n  |       |Cu =   |Zn =   |Ga =   |Ge =   |As =   |Se =   |Br =   |        |\\n  |       |63·57  |65·37  |70·1   |72·5   |74·96  |79·2   |79·92  |        |\\n  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\\n  |Krypton|Rubi-  |Stron- |Yttrium|Zirco- |Colum- |Molyb- |   ?

The atomic weights given are those of\\n    the International Atomic Weights Committee for 1920-1. They are\\n    calculated on the basis, Oxygen = 16. The number of decimal places\\n    given in each case indicates the degree of accuracy with which each\\n    atomic weight has been determined. The letter or letters underneath\\n    the name of each element is the symbol by which it is invariably\\n    designated by chemists.\\n\\n    The number above each column indicates the valency which the\\n    elements of each group exhibit towards oxygen. Many of the elements\\n    are exceptional in this respect.\\n\\n    [a]: The exact position of Hydrogen is in dispute.\\n\\n    [b]: The positions of Argon and Potassium have been inverted in\\n    order that these elements may fall in the right columns with the\\n    elements they resemble; [d]: so also have the positions of Tellurium\\n    and Iodine.\\n\\n    [c]: The whole of “Group 8” forms an exception to the Table.\\n\\n    [e]: There are a number of ill-defined rare earth metals with atomic\\n    weights lying between those of Cerium and Tantalum. They all appear\\n    to resemble the elements of “Group 3,” so that their positions in\\n    the Table cannot be decided with accuracy.\\n\\nIt is now some years since the late Sir William Crookes attempted to\\nexplain the periodicity of the properties of the elements on the theory\\nthat they have all been evolved by a conglomerating process from some\\nprimal stuff--the protyle--consisting of very small particles. He\\nrepresented the action of this generative cause by means of a “figure of\\neight” spiral, along which the elements are placed at regular intervals,\\nso that similar elements come underneath one another, as in Mendeléeff’s\\ntable, though the grouping differs in some respects. The slope of the\\ncurve is supposed to represent the decline of some factor (_e.g._,\\ntemperature) conditioning the process, which process is assumed to be of\\na recurrent nature, like the swing of a pendulum. After the completion\\nof one swing (to keep to the illustration of a pendulum) whereby one\\nseries of elements is produced, owing to the decline of the\\nabove-mentioned factor, the same series of elements is not again the\\nresult as would otherwise be the case, but a somewhat different series\\nis produced, each member of which resembles the corresponding member of\\nthe former series. Thus, if the first series contains, for example,\\nhelium, lithium, carbon, &c., the second series will contain instead,\\nargon, potassium, titanium, &c. The whole theory, though highly\\ninteresting, is, however, by no means free from defects.\\n\\n\\nThe Corpuscular Theory of Matter.\\n\\n§ =79.= We must now turn our attention to those recent views of the\\nconstitution of matter which originated to a great extent in the\\ninvestigations of the passage of electricity through gases at very low\\npressures. It will be possible, however, on the present occasion, to\\ngive only the very briefest account of the subject; but a fuller\\ntreatment is rendered unnecessary by the fact that these and allied\\ninvestigations and the theories to which they have given rise have been\\nfully treated in several well-known works, by various authorities on the\\nsubject, which have appeared during the last few years.[95]\\n\\n    [95] We have found Prof. Harry Jones’ _The Electrical Nature of\\n    Matter and Radioactivity_ (1906), Mr. Soddy’s _Radioactivity_\\n    (1904), and Mr. Whetham’s _The Recent Development of Physical\\n    Science_ (1909) particularly interesting. Mention, of course, should\\n    also be made of the standard works of Prof. Sir J. J. Thomson and\\n    Prof. Rutherford.\\n\\nWhen an electrical discharge is passed through a high-vacuum tube,\\ninvisible rays are emitted from the kathode, generally with the\\nproduction of a greenish-yellow fluorescence where they strike the\\nglass walls of the tube. These rays are called “kathode rays.” At one\\ntime they were regarded as waves in the ether, but it was shown by Sir\\nWilliam Crookes that they consist of small electrically charged\\nparticles, moving with a very high velocity. Sir J. J. Thomson was able\\nto determine the ratio of the charge carried by these particles to their\\nmass or inertia; he found that this ratio was constant whatever gas was\\ncontained in the vacuum tube, and much greater than the corresponding\\nratio for the hydrogen ion (electrically charged hydrogen atom) in\\nelectrolysis. By a skilful method, based on the fact discovered by Mr.\\nC. T. R. Wilson, that charged particles can serve as nuclei for the\\ncondensation of water-vapour, he was further able to determine the value\\nof the electrical charge carried by these particles, which was found to\\nbe constant also, and equal to the charge carried by univalent ions,\\n_e.g._, hydrogen, in electrolysis. Hence, it follows that the mass of\\nthese kathode particles must be much smaller than the hydrogen ion, the\\nactual ratio being about 1\\xa0:\\xa01700. The first theory put forward by Sir\\nJ. J. Thomson in explanation of these facts, was that these kathode\\nparticles (“corpuscles” as he termed them) were electrically charged\\nportions of matter, much smaller than the smallest atom; and since the\\nsame sort of corpuscle is obtained whatever gas is contained in the\\nvacuum tube, it is reasonable to conclude that the corpuscle is the\\ncommon unit of all matter.\\n\\n\\nProof that the Electrons are not Matter.\\n\\n§ =80.= This eminent physicist, however, had shown mathematically that a\\ncharged particle moving with a very high velocity (approaching that of\\nlight) would exhibit an appreciable increase in mass or inertia due to\\nthe charge, the magnitude of such inertia depending on the velocity of\\nthe particle. This was experimentally verified by Kaufmann, who\\ndetermined the velocities, and the ratios between the electrical charge\\nand the inertia, of various kathode particles and similar particles\\nwhich are emitted by compounds of radium (see §§ 89 and 90). Sir J. J.\\nThomson calculated these values on the assumption that the inertia of\\nsuch particles is entirely of electrical origin, and thereby obtained\\nvalues in remarkable agreement with the experimental. There is,\\ntherefore, no reason for supposing the corpuscle to be matter at all;\\nindeed, if it were, the above agreement would not be obtained. As\\nProfessor Jones says: “Since we know things only by their properties,\\nand since all the properties of the corpuscle are accounted for by the\\nelectrical charge associated with it, why assume that the corpuscle\\ncontains anything but the electrical charge? It is obvious that there is\\nno reason for doing so.\\n\\n“_The corpuscle is, then, nothing but a disembodied electrical charge_,\\ncontaining nothing material, as we have been accustomed to use that\\nterm. It is electricity, and nothing but electricity. With this new\\nconception a new term was introduced, and, now, instead of speaking of\\nthe corpuscle we speak of the _electron_.”[96] Applying this\\nmodification to the above view of the constitution of matter, we have\\nwhat is called “the electronic theory,” namely, that the material atoms\\nconsist of electrons, or units of electricity in rapid motion; which\\namounts to this--that matter is simply an electrical phenomenon.\\n\\n    [96] H. C. JONES: _The Electrical Nature of Matter and\\n    Radioactivity_ (1906), p. 21.\\n\\n\\nThe Electronic Theory of Matter.\\n\\n§ =81.= Sir J. J. Thomson has elaborated this theory of the nature and\\nconstitution of matter; he has shown what systems of electrons would be\\nstable, and has attempted to find therein the significance of\\nMendeléeff’s generalisation and the explanation of valency. There can be\\nno doubt that there is a considerable element of truth in the electronic\\ntheory of matter; the one characteristic property of matter, _i.e._,\\ninertia, can be accounted for electrically. The fundamental difficulty\\nis that the electrons are units of negative electricity, whereas matter\\nis electrically neutral. Several theories have been put forward to\\nsurmount this difficulty. Certainly the electron is a constituent of\\nmatter; but is it the sole constituent? Recent research indicates that,\\nas already pointed out, all atoms consist of two distinct portions, a\\nmassive central nucleus, whose net charge is positive, surrounded by a\\nnumber of electrons, just sufficient to neutralize this charge. The\\npoint of greatest interest is that the indicated number of free\\nelectrons is exactly the number which expresses the position of the\\nelement in the Periodic Table, reckoning helium as 2, lithium as 3, and\\nso on; and it would seem that the chemical properties of the elements\\nare determined entirely by these electrons, and are, therefore, not,\\nstrictly speaking, periodic functions of their atomic weights, as was\\nformerly thought (§ 78), but of their atomic numbers. The exact nature\\nof the nuclei of the various atoms has yet to be determined: in the\\ncase of the atoms heavier than helium they would appear to be made up of\\nthe nuclei of hydrogen and (or) helium atoms together with--in many\\ncases--electrons insufficient in number to neutralize the positive\\ncharges associated with these.\\n\\n\\nThe Etheric Theory of Matter.\\n\\n§ =82.= The analysis of matter has been carried a step further. A\\nphilosophical view of the Cosmos involves the assumption of an\\nabsolutely continuous and homogeneous medium filling all space, for an\\nabsolute vacuum is unthinkable, and if it were supposed that the stuff\\nfilling all space is of an atomic structure, the question arises, What\\noccupies the interstices between its atoms? This ubiquitous medium is\\ntermed by the scientists of to-day “the Ether of Space.” Moreover, such\\na medium as the Ether is demanded by the phenomena of light. It appears,\\nhowever, that the ether of space has another and a still more important\\nfunction than the transmission of light: the idea that matter has its\\nexplanation therein has been developed by Sir Oliver Lodge. The evidence\\ncertainly points to the conclusion that matter is some sort of\\nsingularity in the ether, probably a stress centre. We have been too\\nmuch accustomed to think of the ether as something excessively light and\\nquite the reverse of massive or dense, in which it appears we have been\\nwrong. Sir Oliver Lodge calculates that the density of the ether is far\\ngreater than that of the most dense forms of matter; not that matter is\\nto be thought of as a rarefaction of the ether, for the ether within\\nmatter is as dense as that without. What we call matter, however, is not\\na continuous substance; it consists, rather, of a number of widely\\nseparated particles, whence its comparatively small density compared\\nwith the perfectly continuous ether. Further, if there is a difficulty\\nin conceiving how a perfect fluid like the ether can give rise to a\\nsolid body possessed of such properties as rigidity, impenetrability and\\nelasticity, we must remember that all these properties can be produced\\nby means of motion. A jet of water moving with a sufficient velocity\\nbehaves like a rigid and impenetrable solid, whilst a revolving disc of\\npaper exhibits elasticity and can act as a circular saw.[97] It appears,\\ntherefore, that the ancient doctrine of the alchemistic essence is\\nfundamentally true after all, that out of the “One Thing” all material\\nthings have been produced by adaptation or modification; and, as we have\\nalready noticed (§ 60), there also appears to be some resemblance\\nbetween the concept of the electron and that of the seed of gold, which\\nseed, it should be borne in mind, was regarded by the alchemists as the\\ncommon seed of all metals.\\n\\n    [97] See Sir OLIVER LODGE, F.R.S.: _The Ether of Space_ (1909).\\n\\n\\nFurther Evidence of the Complexity of the Atoms.\\n\\n§ =83.= There are also certain other facts which appear to demand such a\\nmodification of Dalton’s Atomic Theory as is found in the Electronic\\nTheory. One of the characteristics of the chemical elements is that each\\none gives a spectrum peculiar to itself. The spectrum of an element\\nmust, therefore, be due to its atoms, which in some way are able, at a\\nsufficiently high temperature, to act upon the ether so as to produce\\nvibrations of definite and characteristic wave-length. Now, in many\\ncases the number of lines of definite wave-length observed in such a\\nspectrum is considerable, for example, hundreds of different lines have\\nbeen observed in the arc-spectrum of iron. But it is incredible that an\\natom, if it were a simple unit, would give rise to such a number of\\ndifferent and definite vibrations, and the only reasonable conclusion is\\nthat the atoms must be complex in structure. We may here mention that\\nspectroscopic examination of various heavenly bodies leads to the\\nconclusion that there is some process of evolution at work building up\\ncomplex elements from simpler ones, since the hottest nebulæ appear to\\nconsist of but a few simple elements, whilst cooler bodies exhibit a\\ngreater complexity.\\n\\n\\nViews of Wald and Ostwald.\\n\\n§ =84.= Such modifications of the atomic theory as those we have briefly\\ndiscussed above, although profoundly modifying, and, indeed,\\ncontroverting the philosophical significance of Dalton’s theory as\\noriginally formulated, leave its chemical significance practically\\nunchanged. The atoms can be regarded no longer as the eternal,\\nindissoluble gods of Nature that they were once supposed to be; thus,\\nMaterialism is deprived of what was thought to be its scientific\\nbasis.[98] But the science of Chemistry is unaffected thereby; the atoms\\nare not the ultimate units out of which material things are built, but\\nthe atoms cannot be decomposed by purely chemical means; the “elements”\\nare not truly elemental, but _they are chemical elements_. However, the\\natomic theory has been subjected to a far more searching criticism. Wald\\nargues that substances obey the law of definite proportions because of\\nthe way in which they are prepared; chemists refuse, he says, to admit\\nany substance as a definite chemical compound unless it does obey this\\nlaw. Wald’s opinions have been supported by Professor Ostwald, who has\\nattempted to deduce the other stoichiometric laws on these grounds\\nwithout assuming any atomic hypothesis[99]; but these new ideas do not\\nappear to have gained the approval of chemists in general. It is not to\\nbe supposed that chemists will give up without a struggle a mental tool\\nof such great utility as Dalton’s theory, in spite of its defects, has\\nproved itself to be. There does seem, however, to be logic in the\\narguments of Wald and Ostwald, but the trend of recent scientific theory\\nand research does not appear to be in the direction of Wald’s views.\\nCertainly, however, it appears that, on the one hand, the atomic theory\\nis not necessitated by the so-called “stoichiometric laws”; but, on the\\nother hand, a molecular constitution of matter seems to be demanded by\\nthe phenomenon known as the “Brownian Movement,” _i.e._, the\\nspontaneous, irregular and apparently perpetual movement of microscopic\\nportions of solid matter when immersed in a liquid medium; such movement\\nappearing to be explicable only as the result of the motion of the\\nmolecules of which the liquid in question is built up.[100]\\n\\n    [98] For a critical examination of Materialism, the reader is\\n    referred to the present writer’s _Matter, Spirit and the Cosmos_\\n    (Rider, 1910), especially Chapters I. and IV.\\n\\n    [99] W.

A new science,\\nhowever, is born amongst us, closely related on the one hand to\\nChemistry, on the other to Physics, but dealing with changes more\\nprofound and reactions more deeply seated than are dealt with by either\\nof these; a science as yet without a name, unless it be the not\\naltogether satisfactory one of “Radioactivity.” It is this science, or,\\nperhaps we should say, a certain aspect of it, to which we refer (it may\\nbe fantastically) by the expression “Modern Alchemy”: the aptness of the\\ntitle we hope to make plain in the course of the present chapter.\\n\\n\\nX-rays and Becquerel rays.\\n\\n§ =86.= As is commonly known, what are called X-rays are produced when\\nan electric discharge is passed through a high-vacuum tube. It has been\\nshown that these rays are a series of irregular pulses in the ether,\\nwhich are set up when the kathode particles strike the walls of the\\nglass vacuum tube,[101] and it was found that more powerful effects can\\nbe produced by inserting a disc of platinum in the path of the kathode\\nparticles. It was M. Becquerel who first discovered that there are\\nsubstances which naturally emit radiations similar to X-rays. He found\\nthat uranium compounds affected a photographic plate from which they\\nwere carefully screened, and he also showed that these uranium\\nradiations, or “Becquerel rays,” resemble X-rays in other particulars.\\nIt was already known that certain substances fluoresce (emit light) in\\nthe dark after having been exposed to sunlight, and it was thought at\\nfirst that the above phenomenon exhibited by uranium salts was of a like\\nnature, since certain uranium salts are fluorescent; but M. Becquerel\\nfound that uranium salts which had never been exposed to sunlight were\\nstill capable of affecting a photographic plate, and that this\\nremarkable property was possessed by all uranium salts, whether\\nfluorescent or not. This phenomenon is known as “radioactivity,” and\\nbodies which exhibit it are said to be “radioactive.” Schmidt found that\\nthorium compounds possess a similar property, and Professor Rutherford\\nshowed that thorium compounds evolved also something resembling a gas.\\nHe called this an “emanation.”\\n\\n    [101] They must not be confused with the greenish-yellow\\n    phosphorescence which is also produced: the X-rays are invisible.\\n\\n\\nThe Discovery of Radium.\\n\\n§ =87.= Mme. Curie[102] determined the radioactivity of many uranium and\\nthorium compounds, and found that there was a proportion between the\\nradioactivity of such compounds and the quantity of uranium or thorium\\nin them, with the remarkable exception of certain natural ores, which\\nhad a radioactivity much in excess of the normal, and, indeed, in\\ncertain cases, much greater than pure uranium. In order to throw some\\nlight on this matter, Mme. Curie prepared one of these ores by a\\nchemical process and found that it possessed a normal radioactivity. The\\nonly logical conclusion to be drawn from these facts was that the ores\\nin question must contain some unknown, highly radioactive substance, and\\nthe Curies were able, after very considerable labour, to extract from\\npitchblende (the ore with the greatest radioactivity) minute quantities\\nof the salts of two new elements--which they named “Polonium” and\\n“Radium” respectively--both of which were extremely radioactive.\\n\\n    [102] See Madame SKLODOWSKA CURIE’S _Radio-active Substances_ (2nd\\n    ed., 1904).\\n\\nM. Debierne has obtained a third radioactive substance from pitchblende,\\nwhich he has called “Actinium.”\\n\\n\\nChemical Properties of Radium.\\n\\n§ =88.= Radium is an element resembling calcium, strontium, and barium\\nin chemical properties; its atomic weight was determined by Mme. Curie,\\nand found to be about 225, according to her first experiments; a\\nredetermination gave a slightly higher value, which has been confirmed\\nby a further investigation carried out by Sir T. E. Thorpe.[103] Radium\\ngives a characteristic spectrum, and is intensely radioactive. It\\nshould be noted that up to the middle of the year 1910 the element\\nradium itself had not been prepared; in all the experiments carried out\\nradium salts were employed (_i.e._, certain compounds of radium with\\nother elements), generally radium chloride and radium bromide. In that\\nyear, however, Mme. Curie, in conjunction with M. Debierne, obtained the\\nfree metal. It is described as a white, shining metal resembling the\\nother alkaline earth metals. It reacts very violently with water, chars\\npaper with which it is allowed to come in contact, and blackens in the\\nair, probably owing to the formation of a nitride. It fuses at 700° C.,\\nand is more volatile than barium.[104]\\n\\n    [103] See Sir T. E. THORPE: “On the Atomic Weight of Radium”\\n    (Bakerian Lecture for 1907.

(For an English\\n    translation of this paper see _The Chemical News_, vol. cii. p.\\n    175.)\\n\\n\\nThe Radioactivity of Radium.\\n\\n§ =89.= Radium salts give off three distinct sorts of rays, referred to\\nby the Greek letters α, β, γ. The α-rays have been shown to consist of\\nelectrically charged (positive) particles, with a mass approximately\\nequal to that of four hydrogen atoms; they are slightly deviated by a\\nmagnetic field, and do not possess great penetrative power. The β-rays\\nare similar to the kathode rays, and consist of (negative) electrons;\\nthey are strongly deviated by a magnetic field, in a direction opposite\\nto that in which the α-particles are deviated, and possess medium\\npenetrative power, passing for the most part through a thin sheet of\\nmetal. The γ-rays resemble X-rays; they possess great penetrative\\npower, and are not deviated by a magnetic field. The difference in the\\neffect of the magnetic field on these rays, and the difference in their\\npenetrative power, led to their detection and allows of their separate\\nexamination. Radium salts emit also an emanation, which tends to become\\noccluded in the solid salt, but can be conveniently liberated by\\ndissolving the salt in water, or by heating it. The emanation exhibits\\nthe characteristic properties of a gas, it obeys Boyle’s Law (_i.e._,\\nits volume varies inversely with its pressure), and it can be condensed\\nto a liquid at low temperatures; its density as determined by the\\ndiffusion method is about 100. Attempts to prepare chemical compounds of\\nthe emanation have failed, and in this respect it resembles the rare\\ngases of the atmosphere--helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon--whence\\nit is probable that its molecules are monatomic, so that a density of\\n100 would give its atomic weight as 200.[105] As can be seen from the\\ntable on pp. 106, 107, an atomic weight of about 220 corresponds to a\\nposition in the column containing the rare gases in the periodic system.\\nThat the emanation actually has an atomic weight of these dimensions was\\nconfirmed by further experiments carried out by the late Sir William\\nRamsay and Dr. R. W. Gray.[106] These chemists determined the density of\\nthe emanation by actually weighing minute quantities of known volume of\\nthe substance, sealed up in small capillary tubes, a specially\\nsensitive balance being employed. Values for the density varying from\\n108 to 113½, corresponding to values for the atomic weight varying from\\n216 to 227, were thereby obtained. Sir William Ramsay, therefore,\\nconsidered that there could no longer be any doubt that the emanation\\nwas one of the elements of the group of chemically inert gases. He\\nproposed to call it _Niton_, and, for reasons which we shall note later,\\nconsidered that in all probability it had an atomic weight of about\\n222½.\\n\\n    [105] This follows from Avogadro’s Hypothesis, see § 76.\\n\\n    [106] Sir WILLIAM RAMSAY and Dr. R. W. GRAY: “La densité de\\n    l’émanation du radium,” _Comptes Rendus hebdomadaires des Séances de\\n    l’Académie des Sciences_, vol. cvi. (1910), pp. 126 _et seq._\\n\\n\\nThe Disintegration of the Radium Atom.\\n\\n§ =90.= Radium salts possess another very remarkable property, namely,\\nthat of continuously emitting light and heat. It seemed, at first, that\\nhere was a startling contradiction to the law of the conservation of\\nenergy, but the whole mystery becomes comparatively clear in terms of\\nthe corpuscular or the electronic theory of matter. The radium-atom is a\\nsystem of a large number (see § 81) of corpuscles or electrons, and\\ncontains in virtue of their motion an enormous amount of energy. But it\\nis known from Chemistry that atomic systems (_i.e._, molecules) which\\ncontain very much energy are unstable and liable to explode. The same\\nlaw holds good on the more interior plane--the radium-atom is liable to,\\nand actually does, explode. And the result? Energy is set free, and\\nmanifests itself partly as heat and light. Some free electrons are shot\\noff (the β-rays), which, striking the undecomposed particles of salt,\\ngive rise to pulses in the ether (the γ-rays),[107] just as the kathode\\nparticles give rise to X-rays when they strike the walls of the vacuum\\ntube or a platinum disc placed in their path. The β- and γ-rays do not,\\nhowever, result immediately from the exploding radium-atoms, the initial\\nproducts being the emanation and one α-particle from each radium-atom\\ndestroyed.\\n\\n    [107] This view regarding the γ-rays is not, however, universally\\n    accepted, some scientists regarding them as consisting of a stream\\n    of particles moving with very high velocities.\\n\\n\\n“Induced Radioactivity.”\\n\\n§ =91.= Radium salts have the property of causing surrounding objects to\\nbecome temporally radioactive. This “induced radioactivity,” as it may\\nbe called, is found to be due to the emanation, which is itself\\nradioactive (it emits α-rays only), and is decomposed into minute traces\\nof solid radioactive deposits. By examining the rate of decay of the\\nactivity of the deposit, it has been found that it is undergoing a\\nseries of sub-atomic changes, the products being termed Radium A, B, C,\\n&c. It has been proved that all the β- and γ-rays emitted by radium\\nsalts are really due to certain of these secondary products. Radium F is\\nthought to be identical with Polonium (§ 87). Another product is also\\nobtained by these decompositions, with which we shall deal later (§ 94).\\n\\n\\nProperties of Uranium and Thorium.\\n\\n§ =92.= Uranium and thorium differ in one important respect from radium,\\ninasmuch as the first product of the decomposition of the uranium and\\nthorium atoms is in both cases solid. Sir William Crookes[108] was able\\nto separate from uranium salts by chemical means a small quantity of an\\nintensely radioactive substance, which he called Uranium X, the residual\\nuranium having lost most of its activity; and M. Becquerel, on\\nrepeating the experiment, found that the activity of the residual\\nuranium was slowly regained, whilst that of the uranium X decayed. This\\nis most simply explained by the theory that uranium first changes into\\nuranium X. It has been suggested that radium may be the final product of\\nthe breaking up of the uranium-atom; at any rate, it is quite certain\\nthat radium must be evolved in some way, as otherwise there would be\\nnone in existence--it would all have decomposed. This suggestion has\\nbeen experimentally confirmed, the growth of radium in large quantities\\nof a solution of purified uranyl nitrate having been observed. Uranium\\ngives no emanation. Thorium probably gives at least three solid\\nproducts--Meso-thorium, Radio-thorium, and Thorium X, the last of which\\nyields an emanation resembling that obtained from radium, but not\\nidentical with it.\\n\\n    [108] Sir WILLIAM CROOKES, F.R.S.: “Radio-activity of Uranium,”\\n    _Proceedings of the Royal Society of London_, vol. lxvi. (1900), pp.\\n    409 _et seq._\\n\\n\\nThe Radium Emanation.\\n\\n§ =93.= We must now more fully consider the radium emanation--a\\nsubstance with more astounding properties than even the radium compounds\\nthemselves. By distilling off the emanation from some radium bromide,\\nand measuring the quantities of heat given off by the emanation and the\\nradium salt respectively, Professors Rutherford and Barnes[109] proved\\nthat nearly three-fourths of the total amount of heat given out by a\\nradium salt comes from the minute quantity of emanation that it\\ncontains. The amount of energy liberated as heat during the decay of the\\nemanation is enormous; one cubic centimetre liberates about four\\nmillion times as much heat as is obtained by the combustion of an equal\\nvolume of hydrogen. Undoubtedly this must indicate some profound change,\\nand one may well ask, What is the ultimate product of the decomposition\\nof the emanation?\\n\\n    [109] E. RUTHERFORD, F.R.S., and H. T. BARNES, D.Sc.: “Heating\\n    Effect of the Radium Emanation,” _Philosophical Magazine_ [6], vol.\\n    vii. (1904), pp. 202 _et seq._\\n\\n\\nThe Production of Helium from Radium.\\n\\n§ =94.= It had been observed already that the radioactive minerals on\\nheating give off Helium--a gaseous element, characterised by a\\nparticular yellow line in its spectrum--and it seemed not unlikely that\\nhelium might be the ultimate decomposition product of the emanation. A\\nresearch to settle this point was undertaken by Sir William Ramsay and\\nMr. Soddy,[110] and a preliminary experiment having confirmed the above\\nspeculation, they carried out further very careful experiments. “The\\nmaximum amount of the emanation obtained from 50 milligrams of radium\\nbromide was conveyed by means of oxygen into a [U]-tube cooled in liquid\\nair, and the latter was then extracted by the pump.” The spectrum was\\nobserved; it “was apparently a new one, probably that of the emanation\\nitself. .\\xa0.\\xa0. After standing from July 17 to 21 the helium spectrum\\nappeared, and the characteristic lines were observed.” Sir William\\nRamsay performed a further experiment with a similar result, in which\\nthe radium salt had been first of all heated in a vacuum for some time,\\nproving that the helium obtained could not have been occluded in it;\\nthough the fact that the helium spectrum did not immediately appear, in\\nitself proves this point. Sir William Ramsay’s results were confirmed\\nby further careful experiments by Sir James Dewar and other chemists. It\\nwas suggested, therefore, that the α-particle consists of an\\nelectrically charged helium-atom, and not only is this view in agreement\\nwith the value of the mass of this particle as determined\\nexperimentally, but it has been completely demonstrated by Professor\\nRutherford and Mr. Royds. These chemists performed an experiment in\\nwhich the emanation from about one-seventh of a gramme of radium was\\nenclosed in a thin-walled tube, through the walls of which the\\nα-particles could pass, but which were impervious to gases. This tube\\nwas surrounded by an outer jacket, which was evacuated. After a time the\\npresence of helium in the space between the inner tube and the outer\\njacket was observed spectroscopically.[111] Now, the emanation-atom\\nresults from the radium-atom by the expulsion of one α-particle; and\\nsince this latter consists of an electrically charged helium-atom, it\\nfollows that the emanation must have an atomic weight of 226 - 4,\\n_i.e._, 222. This value is in agreement with Sir William Ramsay’s\\ndetermination of the density of the emanation. We may represent the\\ndegradation of the radium-atom, therefore, by the following scheme:--\\n\\n               α-particle (Helium-atom)\\n              /           4\\n  Radium-atom                          α-particle (Helium-atom)\\n      226     \\\\                       /           4\\n                Emanation (Niton-atom)\\n                         222          \\\\\\n                                       Radium-A, &c.\\n\\n    [110] Sir WILLIAM RAMSAY and FREDERICK SODDY: “Experiments in\\n    Radioactivity and the Production of Helium from Radium,”\\n    _Proceedings of the Royal Society of London_, vol. lxxii.

ROYDS, M.Sc.: “The Nature of the\\n    α-Particle from Radio-active Substances,” _Philosophical Magazine_\\n    [6], vol. xvii. (1909), pp. 281 _et seq._\\n\\n\\nNature of this Change.\\n\\n§ =95.= Here, then, for the first time in the history of Chemistry, we\\nhave the undoubted formation of one chemical element from another, for,\\nleaving out of the question the nature of the emanation, there can be no\\ndoubt that radium is a chemical element. This is a point which must be\\ninsisted upon, for it has been suggested that radium may be a compound\\nof helium with some unknown element; or, perhaps, a compound of helium\\nwith lead, since it has been shown that lead is probably one of the end\\nproducts of the decomposition of radium. The following considerations,\\nhowever, show this view to be altogether untenable: (i.) All attempts to\\nprepare compounds of helium with other elements have failed. (ii.)\\nRadium possesses all the properties of a chemical element; it has a\\ncharacteristic spectrum, and falls in that column in the Periodic Table\\nwith those elements which it resembles as to its chemical properties.\\n(iii.) The quantity of heat liberated on the decomposition of the\\nemanation is, as we have already indicated, out of all proportion to\\nthat obtained even in the most violent chemical reactions; and (iv.) one\\nvery important fact has been observed, namely, that the rate of decay of\\nthe emanation is unaffected by even extreme changes of temperature,\\nwhereas chemical actions are always affected in rate by changes of\\ntemperature. It will also be advisable, perhaps, to indicate some of the\\ndifferences between helium and the emanation. The latter is a heavy gas,\\ncondensable to a liquid by liquid air (recently it has been\\nsolidified[112]); whereas helium is the lightest of all known gases\\nwith the exception of hydrogen and has been liquefied only by the most\\npersistent effort.[113] The emanation, moreover, is radioactive, giving\\noff α-particles, whereas helium does not possess this property.\\n\\n    [112] By Ramsay. See _Proceedings of the Chemical Society_, vol.\\n    xxv. (1909), pp. 82 and 83.\\n\\n    [113] By Professor Onnes. See _Chemical News_, vol. xcviii. p. 37\\n    (July 24, 1908).\\n\\n\\nIs this Change a true Transmutation?\\n\\n§ =96.= It has been pointed out, however, that (in a sense) this change\\n(viz., of emanation into helium) is not quite what has been meant by the\\nexpression “transmutation of the elements”; for the reason that it is a\\n_spontaneous_ change; no effort of ours can bring it about or cause it\\nto cease.[114] But the fact of the change does go to prove that the\\nchemical elements are not the discrete units of matter that they were\\nsupposed to be. And since it appears that all matter is radioactive,\\nalthough (save in these exceptional cases) in a very slight degree,[115]\\nwe here have evidence of a process of evolution at work among the\\nchemical elements. The chemical elements are not permanent; they are all\\nundergoing change; and the common elements merely mark those points\\nwhere the rate of the evolutionary process is at its slowest. (See also\\n§§ 78 and 83.) Thus, the essential truth in the old alchemistic doctrine\\nof the growth of metals is vindicated, for the metals do grow in the\\nwomb of Nature, although the process may be far slower than appears to\\nhave been imagined by certain of the alchemists,[116] and although gold\\nmay not be the end product. As writes Professor Sir W. Tilden: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. It\\nappears that modern ideas as to the genesis of the elements, and hence\\nof all matter, stand in strong contrast with those which chiefly\\nprevailed among experimental philosophers from the time of Newton, and\\nseem to reflect in an altered form the speculative views of the\\nancients.” “.\\xa0.\\xa0. It seems probable,” he adds, “that the chemical\\nelements, and hence all material substances of which the earth, the sea,\\nthe air, and the host of heavenly bodies are all composed, resulted from\\na change, corresponding to condensation, in something of which we have\\nno direct and intimate knowledge. Some have imagined this primal essence\\nof all things to be identical with the ether of space. As yet we know\\nnothing with certainty, but it is thought that by means of the\\nspectroscope some stages of the operation may be seen in progress in the\\nnebulæ and stars. .\\xa0.\\xa0.”[117] We have next to consider whether there is\\nany experimental evidence showing it to be possible (using the\\nphraseology of the alchemists) for man to assist in Nature’s work.\\n\\n    [114] See Professor H. C. JONES: _The Electrical Nature of Matter\\n    and Radioactivity_ (1906), pp. 125-126.\\n\\n    [115] It has been definitely proved, for example, that the common\\n    element potassium is radioactive, though very feebly so (it emits\\n    β-rays). It is also interesting to note that many common substances\\n    emit corpuscles at high temperatures.\\n\\n    [116] Says Peter Bonus, however, “.\\xa0.\\xa0. we know that the generation\\n    of metals occupies thousands of years .\\xa0.\\xa0. in Nature’s workshop.\\n    .\\xa0.\\xa0.” (see _The New Pearl of Great Price_, Mr. A. E. Waite’s\\n    translation, p. 55), and certain others of the alchemists expressed\\n    a similar view.\\n\\n    [117] Sir WILLIAM A. TILDEN: _The Elements: Speculations as to their\\n    Nature and Origin_ (1910), pp. 108, 109, 133 and 134. With regard to\\n    Sir William Tilden’s remarks, it is very interesting to note that\\n    Swedenborg (who was born when Newton was between forty and fifty\\n    years old) not only differed from that great philosopher on those\\n    very points on which modern scientific philosophy is at variance\\n    with Newton, but, as is now recognised by scientific men,\\n    anticipated many modern discoveries and scientific theories. It\\n    would be a most interesting task to set forth the agreement existing\\n    between Swedenborg’s theories and the latest products of scientific\\n    thought concerning the nature of the physical universe. Such,\\n    however, would lie without the confines of the present work.\\n\\n\\nThe Production of Neon from Emanation.\\n\\n§ =97.= As we have already indicated above (§ 93), the radium emanation\\ncontains a vast store of potential energy, and it was with the idea of\\nutilising this energy for bringing about chemical changes that Sir\\nWilliam Ramsay[118] undertook a research on the chemical action of this\\nsubstance--a research with the most surprising and the most interesting\\nresults, for the energy contained within the radium emanation appeared\\nto behave like a veritable Philosopher’s Stone. The first experiments\\nwere carried out on distilled water. It had already been observed that\\nthe emanation decomposes water into its gaseous elements, oxygen and\\nhydrogen, and that the latter is always produced in excess. These\\nresults were confirmed and the presence of hydrogen peroxide was\\ndetected, explaining the formation of an excess of hydrogen; it was also\\nshown that the emanation brings about the reverse change to some extent,\\ncausing oxygen and hydrogen to unite with the production of water, until\\na position of equilibrium is attained. On examining spectroscopically\\nthe gas obtained by the action of the emanation on water, after the\\nremoval of the ordinary gases, a most surprising result was\\nobserved--the gas showed a brilliant spectrum of neon, accompanied with\\nsome faint helium lines. A more careful experiment was carried out later\\nby Sir William Ramsay and Mr. Cameron, in which a silica bulb was\\nemployed instead of glass. The spectrum of the residual gas after\\nremoving ordinary gases was successfully photographed, and a large\\nnumber of the neon lines identified; helium was also present. The\\npresence of neon could not be explained, in Ramsay’s opinion, by leakage\\nof air into the apparatus, as the percentage of neon in the air is not\\nsufficiently high, whereas this suggestion might be put forward in the\\ncase of argon. Moreover, the neon could not have come from the aluminium\\nof the electrodes (in which it might be thought to have been occluded),\\nas the sparking tube had been used and tested before the experiment was\\ncarried out. The authors conclude: “We must regard the transformation of\\nemanation into neon, in presence of water, as indisputably proved, and,\\nif a transmutation be defined as a transformation brought about at will,\\nby change of conditions, then _this is the first case of transmutation\\nof which conclusive evidence is put forward_.”[119] However, Professor\\nRutherford and Mr. Royds have been unable to confirm this result. They\\ndescribe[120] attempts to obtain neon by the action of emanation on\\nwater. Out of five experiments no neon was obtained, save in one case in\\nwhich a small air leak was discovered; and, since the authors find that\\nvery minute quantities of this gas are sufficient to give a clearly\\nvisible spectrum, they conclude that Ramsay’s positive results are due,\\nafter all, to leakage of air into the apparatus. But if this is the true\\nexplanation of Ramsay’s results, it is difficult to understand why, in\\nthe case of the experiment with a solution of a copper salt described\\nbelow, the presence of neon was not detected, for, if due to leakage,\\nthe proportions of the rare gases present should presumably have been\\nthe same in all the experiments. Further research seems necessary\\nconclusively to settle the question.\\n\\n    [118] Sir WILLIAM RAMSAY: “The Chemical Action of the Radium\\n    Emanation. Pt.

These “modern alchemists,”\\ntherefore, proceeded to investigate the action of radium emanation on\\nsolutions of copper and lead salts, and again apparently effected\\ntransmutations. They found on removing the copper from a solution of a\\ncopper-salt which had been subjected to the action of the emanation, and\\nspectroscopically examining the residue, that a considerable quantity of\\nsodium was present, together with traces of lithium; and the gas evolved\\nin the case of a solution of copper nitrate contained, along with much\\nnitric oxide and a little nitrogen, argon (which was detected\\nspectroscopically), but no helium. It certainly seemed like a dual\\ntransformation of copper into lithium and sodium, and emanation into\\nargon. They also observed that apparently carbon-dioxide is continually\\nevolved from an acid solution of thorium nitrate (see below, § 100). It\\nis worth while noticing that helium, neon and argon occur in the same\\ncolumn in the Periodic Table with emanation; lithium and sodium with\\ncopper, and carbon with thorium; in each case the elements produced\\nbeing of lighter atomic weight than those decomposed.[121] The authors\\nmake the following suggestions: “(1) That helium and the α-particle are\\nnot identical; (2) that helium results from the ‘degradation’ of the\\nlarge molecule of emanation by its bombardment with α-particles; (3)\\nthat this ‘degradation,’ when the emanation is alone or mixed with\\noxygen and hydrogen, results in the lowest member of the inactive\\nseries, namely, helium; (4) that if particles of greater mass than\\nhydrogen or oxygen are associated with the emanation, namely, liquid\\nwater, then the ‘degradation’ of the emanation is less complete, and\\nneon is produced; (5) that when molecules of still greater weight and\\ncomplexity are present, as is the case when the emanation is dissolved\\nin a solution of copper sulphate, the product of ‘degradation’ of the\\nemanation is argon. We are inclined to believe too [they say] that (6)\\nthe copper also is involved in this process of degradation, and is\\nreduced to the lowest term of its series, namely, lithium; and at the\\nsame time, inasmuch as the weight of the residue of alkali, produced\\nwhen copper nitrate is present, is double that obtained from the blank\\nexperiment, or from water alone, the supposition is not excluded that\\nthe chief product of the ‘degradation’ of copper is sodium.”[122]\\n\\n    [121] See pp. 106, 107.\\n\\n    [122] _Journal of the Chemical Society_, vol. xci. (1907), pp.\\n    1605-1606. More recent experiments, however, proved that the\\n    α-particle does consist of an electrically charged helium-atom, and\\n    this view was latterly accepted by Sir William Ramsay, so that the\\n    above suggestions must be modified in accordance therewith. (See §\\n    94.)\\n\\n\\nFurther Experiments on Radium and Copper.\\n\\n§ =99.= A little later Madame Curie and Mademoiselle Gleditsch[123]\\nrepeated Cameron and Ramsay’s experiments on copper salts, using,\\nhowever, platinum apparatus. They failed to detect lithium after the\\naction of the emanation, and think that Cameron and Ramsay’s results may\\nbe due to the glass vessels employed. Dr. Perman[124] has investigated\\nthe direct action of the emanation on copper and gold, and has failed to\\ndetect any trace of lithium. The transmutation of copper into lithium,\\ntherefore, must be regarded as unproved, but further research is\\nnecessary before any conclusive statements can be made on the subject.\\n\\n    [123] Madame CURIE and Mademoiselle GLEDITSCH: “Action de\\n    l’émanation du radium sur les solutions des sels de cuivre,”\\n    _Comptes Rendus hebdomadaires des Séances de l’Académie des\\n    Sciences_, vol. cxlvii.

The action of radium emanation on\\ncompounds (not containing carbon) of other members of the carbon group,\\nnamely, silicon, zirconium and lead, was then investigated; in the cases\\nof zirconium nitrate and hydro-fluosilicic acid, carbon-dioxide was\\nobtained; but in the case of lead chlorate the amount of carbon dioxide\\nwas quite insignificant. Curiously enough, the perchlorate of bismuth, a\\nmetal which belongs to the nitrogen group of elements, also yielded\\ncarbon-dioxide when acted on by emanation. Sir William Ramsay concludes\\nhis discussion of these experiments as follows: “Such are the facts. No\\none is better aware than I how insufficient the proof is. Many other\\nexperiments must be made before it can confidently be asserted that\\ncertain elements, when exposed to ‘concentrated energy,’ undergo\\ndegradation into carbon.” Some such confirmatory experiments were\\ncarried out by Sir William Ramsay and Mr. Francis L. Usher, and they\\nalso described an experiment with a compound of titanium. Their results\\nconfirm Sir William Ramsay’s former experiments. Carbon-dioxide was\\nobtained in appreciable quantities by the action of emanation on\\ncompounds of silicon, titanium, zirconium and thorium. In the case of\\nlead, the amount of carbon dioxide obtained was inappreciable.[126]\\n\\n    [125] Sir WILLIAM RAMSAY: “Elements and Electrons,” _Journal of the\\n    Chemical Society_, vol. xcv. (1909), pp. 624 _et seq._\\n\\n    [126] For a brief account in English of these later experiments see\\n    _The Chemical News_, vol. c. p. 209 (October 29, 1909).\\n\\n\\nThe Possibility of Making Gold.\\n\\n§ =101.= It does not seem unlikely that if it is possible to “degrade”\\nelements, it may be possible to build them up. It has been suggested\\nthat it might be possible to obtain, in this way, gold from silver,\\nsince these two elements occur in the same column in the Periodic Table;\\nbut the suggestion still awaits experimental confirmation. The question\\narises, What would be the result if gold could be cheaply produced? That\\ngold is a metal admirably adapted for many purposes, for which its\\nscarcity prevents its use, must be admitted. But the financial chaos\\nwhich would follow if it were to be cheaply obtained surpasses the\\nordinary imagination. It is a theme that ought to appeal to a novelist\\nof exceptional imaginative power. However, we need not fear these\\nresults, for not only is radium extremely rare, far dearer than gold,\\nand on account of its instability will never be obtained in large\\nquantities, but, judging from the above-described experiments, if,\\nindeed, the radium emanation is the true Philosopher’s Stone, the\\nquantity of gold that may be hoped for by its aid is extremely small.\\n\\n\\nThe Significance of “Allotropy.”\\n\\n§ =102.= A very suggestive argument for the transmutation of the metals\\nwas put forward by Professor Henry M. Howe, LL.D., in a paper entitled\\n“Allotropy or Transmutation?” read before the British Association\\n(Section B), Sheffield Meeting, 1910. Certain substances are known\\nwhich, although differing in their physical properties very markedly,\\nbehave chemically as if they were one and the same element, giving rise\\nto the same series of compounds. Such substances, of which we may\\nmention diamond, graphite and charcoal (_e.g._, lampblack)--all of which\\nare known chemically as “carbon”--or, to take another example, yellow\\nphosphorus (a yellow, waxy, highly inflammable solid) and red phosphorus\\n(a difficultly-inflammable, dark red substance, probably possessing a\\nminutely crystalline structure), are, moreover, convertible one into the\\nother.[127] It has been customary to refer to such substances as\\ndifferent forms or allotropic modifications of the same element, and not\\nto regard them as being different elements. As Professor Howe says, “If\\nafter defining ‘elements’ as substances hitherto indivisible, and\\ndifferent elements as those which differ in at least some one property,\\nand after asserting that the elements cannot be transmuted into each\\nother, we are confronted with the change from diamond into lampblack,\\nand with the facts, first, that each is clearly indivisible hitherto\\nand hence an element, and, second, that they differ in every property,\\nwe try to escape in a circle by saying that they are not different\\nelements because they do change into each other. In short, we limit the\\nname ‘element’ to indivisible substances which cannot be transmuted into\\neach other, and we define those which do transmute as _ipso facto_ one\\nelement, and then we say that the elements cannot be transmuted. Is not\\nthis very like saying that, if you call a calf’s tail a leg, then a calf\\nhas five legs? And if it is just to reply that calling a tail a leg does\\nnot make it a leg, is it not equally just to reply that calling two\\ntransmutable elements one element does not make them so?\\n\\n    [127] Diamond is transformed into graphite when heated by a powerful\\n    electric current between carbon poles, and both diamond and graphite\\n    can be indirectly converted into charcoal. The artificial production\\n    of the diamond, however, is a more difficult process; but the late\\n    Professor Moissan succeeded in effecting it, so far as very small\\n    diamonds are concerned, by dissolving charcoal in molten iron or\\n    silver and allowing it to crystallise from the solution under high\\n    pressure. Graphite was also obtained. Red phosphorus is produced\\n    from yellow phosphorus by heating the latter in absence of air. The\\n    temperature 240-250° C. is the most suitable; at higher temperatures\\n    the reverse change sets in, red phosphorus being converted into\\n    yellow phosphorus.\\n\\n“Is it philosophical to point to the fact that two such transmutable\\nelements yield but a single line of derivatives as proof that they are\\none element? Is not this rather proof of the readiness, indeed\\nirresistibleness, of their transmutation? Does not this simply mean that\\nthe derivativeless element, whenever it enters into combination,\\ninevitably transmutes into its mate which has derivatives?”[128]\\n\\n    [128] Professor HENRY M. HOWE, LL.D.: “Allotropy or Transmutation.”\\n    (See _The Chemical News_, vol. cii. pp. 153 and 154, September 23,\\n    1910.)\\n\\nAccording to the atomic theory the differences between what are termed\\n“allotropic modifications” are generally ascribed to differences in the\\nnumber and arrangement of the atoms constituting the molecules of such\\n“modifications,” and not to any differences in the atoms themselves. But\\nwe cannot argue that two such “allotropic modifications” or elements\\nwhich are transmutable into one another are one and the same element,\\nbecause they possess the same atomic weight, and different elements are\\ndistinguished by different atomic weights; for the reason that, in the\\ndetermination of atomic weights, derivatives of such bodies are\\nemployed; hence, the value obtained is the atomic weight of the element\\nwhich forms derivatives, from which that of its derivativeless mate may\\ndiffer considerably for all we know to the contrary, if we do, indeed,\\nregard the atomic weights of the elements as having any meaning beyond\\nexpressing the inertia-ratios in which they combine one with another.\\n\\nIf we wish to distinguish between two such “allotropic modifications”\\napart from any theoretical views concerning the nature and constitution\\nof matter, we can say that such “modifications” are different because\\nequal weights of them contain, or are equivalent to, different\\nquantities of energy,[129] since the change of one “form” to another\\ntakes place only with the evolution or absorption (as the case may be)\\nof heat.[130] But, according to modern views regarding the nature of\\nmatter, this is the sole fundamental difference between two different\\nelements--such are different because equal weights of them contain or\\nare equivalent to different quantities of energy. The so-called\\n“allotropic modifications of an element,” therefore, are just as much\\ndifferent elements as any other different elements, and the change from\\none “modification” to another is a true transmutation of the elements;\\nthe only distinction being that what are called “allotropic\\nmodifications of the same element” differ only slightly in respect of\\nthe energy they contain, and hence are comparatively easy to convert one\\ninto the other, whereas different elements (so called) differ very\\ngreatly from one another in this respect, whence it is to be concluded\\nthat the transmutation of one such element into another will only be\\nattained by the utilisation of energy in a very highly concentrated\\nform, such as is evolved simultaneously with the spontaneous\\ndecomposition of the radium emanation.\\n\\n    [129] For a defence of the view that chemical substances may be\\n    regarded as energy-complexes, and that this view is equally as valid\\n    as the older notion of a chemical substance as an inertia-complex,\\n    _i.e._, as something made up entirely of different units or atoms\\n    each characterised by the possession of a definite and constant\\n    weight at a fixed point on the earth’s surface, see an article by\\n    the present writer, entitled “The Claims of Thermochemistry,”\\n    _Knowledge and Scientific News_, vol. vii. (New Series), pp. 227 _et\\n    seq._ (July, 1910).\\n\\n    [130] In some cases the heat change accompanying the transformation\\n    of an element into an “allotropic modification” can be measured\\n    directly. More frequently, however, it is calculated as the\\n    difference between the quantities of heat obtained when the two\\n    “forms” are converted into one and the same compound.\\n\\n\\nConclusion.\\n\\n§ =103.= We have shown that modern science indicates the essential truth\\nof alchemistic doctrine, and our task is ended. Writing in 1904, Sir\\nWilliam Ramsay said: “If these hypotheses [concerning the possibility of\\ncausing the atoms of ordinary elements to absorb energy] are just, then\\nthe transmutations of the elements no longer appears an idle dream. The\\nphilosopher’s stone will have been discovered, and it is not beyond the\\nbounds of possibility that it may lead to that other goal of the\\nphilosophers of the dark ages--the _elixir vitæ_. For the action of\\nliving cells is also dependent on the nature and direction of the energy\\nwhich they contain; and who can say that it will be impossible to\\ncontrol their action, when the means of imparting and controlling energy\\nshall have been investigated?”[131] Whatever may be the final verdict\\nconcerning his own experiments, those of Sir Ernest Rutherford, referred\\nto in the Preface to the present edition, demonstrate the fact of\\ntransmutation; and it is worth noticing how many of the alchemists’\\nobscure descriptions of their Magistery well apply to that marvellous\\nsomething which we call Energy, the true “First Matter” of the Universe.\\nAnd of the other problem, the _Elixir Vitæ_, who knows?\\n\\n    [131] Sir WILLIAM RAMSAY: “Radium and its Products,” _Harper’s\\n    Magazine_ (December 1904), vol. xlix.

But still more welcome is the change in the\\nattitude of the educated world towards the old-time alchemists and their\\ntheories which has taken place during the past few years.\\n\\nThe theory of the origin of Alchemy put forward in Chapter I has led to\\nconsiderable discussion; but whilst this theory has met with general\\nacceptance, some of its earlier critics took it as implying far more\\nthan is actually the case. As a result of further research my conviction\\nof its truth has become more fully confirmed, and in my recent work\\nentitled _Bygone Beliefs_ (Rider, 1920), under the title of “The Quest\\nof the Philosopher’s Stone,” I have found it possible to adduce further\\nevidence in this connection. At the same time, whilst I became\\nincreasingly convinced that the main alchemistic hypotheses were drawn\\nfrom the domain of mystical theology and applied to physics and\\nchemistry by way of analogy, it also became evident to me that the crude\\nphysiology of bygone ages and remnants of the old phallic faith formed a\\nfurther and subsidiary source of alchemistic theory. I have barely, if\\nat all, touched on this matter in the present work; the reader who is\\ninterested will find it dealt with in some detail in “The Phallic\\nElement in Alchemical Doctrine” in my _Bygone Beliefs_.\\n\\nIn view of recent research in the domain of Radioactivity and the\\nconsequent advance in knowledge that has resulted since this book was\\nfirst published, I have carefully considered the advisability of\\nrewriting the whole of the last chapter, but came to the conclusion that\\nthe time for this was not yet ripe, and that, apart from a few minor\\nemendations, the chapter had better remain very much as it originally\\nstood. My reason for this course was that, whilst considerably more is\\nknown to-day, than was the case in 1911, concerning the very complex\\ntransmutations undergone spontaneously by the radioactive\\nelements--knowledge helping further to elucidate the problem of the\\nconstitution of the so-called “elements” of the chemist--the problem\\nreally cognate to my subject, namely that of effecting a transmutation\\nof one element into another at will, remains in almost the same state of\\nindeterminateness as in 1911. In 1913, Sir William Ramsay[1] thought he\\nhad obtained evidence for the transmutation of hydrogen into helium by\\nthe action of the electric discharge, and Professors Collie and\\nPatterson[2] thought they had obtained evidence of the transmutation of\\nhydrogen into neon by similar means. But these observations (as well as\\nSir William Ramsay’s earlier transmutational experiments) failed to be\\nsatisfactorily confirmed;[3] and since the death of the latter, little,\\nif anything, appears to have been done to settle the questions raised by\\nhis experiments. Reference must, however, be made to a very interesting\\ninvestigation by Sir Ernest Rutherford on the “Collision of α-Particles\\nwith Light Atoms,”[4] from which it appears certain that when bombarded\\nwith the swiftly-moving α-particles given off by radium-C, the atoms of\\nnitrogen may be disintegrated, one of the products being hydrogen. The\\nother product is possibly helium,[5] though this has not been proved. In\\nview of Rutherford’s results a further repetition of Ramsay’s\\nexperiments would certainly appear to be advisable.\\n\\n    [1] See his “The Presence of Helium in the Gas from the Interior of\\n    an X-Ray Bulb,” _Journal of the Chemical Society_, vol. ciii.\\n    (1913), pp. 264 _et seq._\\n\\n    [2] See their “The Presence of Neon in Hydrogen after the Passage of\\n    the Electric Discharge through the latter at Low Pressures,”\\n    _ibid._, pp. 419 _et seq._; and “The Production of Neon and Helium\\n    by the Electric Discharge,” _Proceedings of the Royal Society_, _A_,\\n    vol. xci. (1915), pp. 30 _et seq._\\n\\n    [3] See especially the report of negative experiments by Mr. A. C.\\n    G. Egerton, published in _Proceedings of the Royal Society_, _A_,\\n    vol. xci. (1915), pp. 180 _et seq._\\n\\n    [4] See the _Philosophical Magazine_ for June, 1919, 6th Series,\\n    vol. xxxvii. pp. 537-587.\\n\\n    [5] Or perhaps an isotope of helium (see below).\\n\\nAs concerns the spontaneous transmutations undergone by the radioactive\\nelements, the facts appear to indicate (or, at least, can be brought\\ninto some sort of order by supposing) the atom to consist of a central\\nnucleus and an outer shell, as suggested by Sir Ernest Rutherford. The\\nnucleus may be compared to the sun of a solar system. It is excessively\\nsmall, but in it the mass of the atom is almost entirely concentrated.\\nIt is positively charged, the charge being neutralised by that of the\\nfree electrons which revolve like planets about it, and which by their\\norbits account for the volume of the atom. The atomic weight of the\\nelement depends upon the central sun; but the chemical properties of the\\nelement are determined by the number of electrons in the shell; this\\nnumber is the same as that representing the position of the element in\\nthe periodic system. Radioactive change originates in the atomic\\nnucleus. The expulsion of an α-particle therefrom decreases the atomic\\nweight by 4 units, necessitates (since the α-particle carries two\\npositive charges) the removal of two electrons from the shell in order\\nto maintain electrical neutrality, and hence changes the chemical nature\\nof the body, transmuting the element into one occupying a position two\\nplaces to the left in the periodic system (for example, the change of\\nradium into niton). But radioactivity sometimes results in the expulsion\\nof a β-particle from the nucleus. This results in the addition of an\\nelectron to the shell, and hence changes the chemical character of the\\nelement, transmuting it into one occupying a position one place to the\\nright in the periodic system, but _without altering its atomic weight_.\\nConsequently, the expulsion of one α- and two β-particles from the\\nnucleus, whilst decreasing the atomic weight of the element by 4, leaves\\nthe number of electrons in the shell, and thus the chemical properties\\nof the element, unaltered. These remarkable conclusions are amply borne\\nout by the facts, and the discovery of elements (called “isobares”)\\nhaving the same atomic weight but different chemical properties, and of\\nthose (called “isotopes”) having identical chemical characters but\\ndifferent atomic weights, must be regarded as one of the most\\nsignificant and important discoveries of recent years. Some further\\nreference to this theory will be found in §§ 77 and 81: the reader who\\nwishes to follow the matter further should consult the fourth edition of\\nProfessor Frederick Soddy’s _The Interpretation of Radium_ (1920), and\\nthe two chapters on the subject in his _Science and Life_ (1920), one of\\nwhich is a popular exposition and the other a more technical one.\\n\\nThese advances in knowledge all point to the possibility of effecting\\ntransmutations at will, but so far attempts to achieve this, as I have\\nalready indicated, cannot be regarded as altogether satisfactory.\\nSeveral methods of making gold, or rather elements chemically identical\\nwith gold, once the method of controlling radioactive change is\\ndiscovered (as assuredly it will be) are suggested by Sir Ernest\\nRutherford’s theory of the nuclear atom. Thus, the expulsion of two\\nα-particles from bismuth or one from thallium would yield the required\\nresult. Or lead could be converted into mercury by the expulsion of one\\nα-particle, and this into thallium by the expulsion of one β-particle,\\nyielding gold by the further expulsion of an α-particle. But, as\\nProfessor Soddy remarks in his _Science and Life_ just referred to, “if\\nman ever achieves this further control over Nature, it is quite certain\\nthat the last thing he would want to do would be to turn lead or mercury\\ninto gold--_for the sake of gold_. The energy that would be liberated,\\nif the control of these sub-atomic processes were as possible as is the\\ncontrol of ordinary chemical changes, such as combustion, would far\\nexceed in importance and value the gold. Rather it would pay to\\ntransmute gold into silver or some base metal.”\\n\\nIn § 101 of the book I suggest that the question of the effect on the\\nworld of finance of the discovery of an inexpensive method of\\ntransmuting base metal into gold on a large scale is one that should\\nappeal to a novelist specially gifted with imagination. Since the words\\nwere first written a work has appeared in which something approximating\\nto what was suggested has been attempted and very admirably achieved. My\\nreference is to Mr. H. G. Wells’s novel, _The World Set Free_, published\\nin 1914.\\n\\nIn conclusion I should like to thank the very many reviewers who found\\nso many good things to say concerning the first edition of this book.\\nFor kind assistance in reading the proofs of this edition my best thanks\\nare due also and are hereby tendered to my wife, and my good friend\\nGerald Druce, Esq., M.Sc.\\n\\n  H. S. R.\\n\\n  191, CAMDEN ROAD, LONDON, N.W. 1.\\n  _October_, 1921.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE\\n\\n\\nThe number of books in the English language dealing with the interesting\\nsubject of Alchemy is not sufficiently great to render an apology\\nnecessary for adding thereto. Indeed, at the present time there is an\\nactual need for a further contribution on this subject. The time is gone\\nwhen it was regarded as perfectly legitimate to point to Alchemy as an\\ninstance of the aberrations of the human mind. Recent experimental\\nresearch has brought about profound modifications in the scientific\\nnotions regarding the chemical elements, and, indeed, in the scientific\\nconcept of the physical universe itself; and a certain resemblance can\\nbe traced between these later views and the theories of bygone Alchemy.\\nThe spontaneous change of one “element” into another has been witnessed,\\nand the recent work of Sir William Ramsay suggests the possibility of\\nrealising the old alchemistic dream--the transmutation of the “base”\\nmetals into gold.\\n\\nThe basic idea permeating all the alchemistic theories appears to have\\nbeen this: All the metals (and, indeed, all forms of matter) are one in\\norigin, and are produced by an evolutionary process. The Soul of them\\nall is one and the same; it is only the Soul that is permanent; the\\nbody or outward form, _i.e._, the mode of manifestation of the Soul, is\\ntransitory, and one form may be transmuted into another. The similarity,\\nindeed it might be said, the identity, between this view and the modern\\netheric theory of matter is at once apparent.\\n\\nThe old alchemists reached the above conclusion by a theoretical method,\\nand attempted to demonstrate the validity of their theory by means of\\nexperiment; in which, it appears, they failed. Modern science, adopting\\nthe reverse process, for a time lost hold of the idea of the unity of\\nthe physical universe, to gain it once again by the experimental method.\\nIt was in the elaboration of this grand fundamental idea that Alchemy\\nfailed. If I were asked to contrast Alchemy with the chemical and\\nphysical science of the nineteenth century I would say that, whereas the\\nlatter abounded in a wealth of much accurate detail and much relative\\ntruth, it lacked philosophical depth and insight; whilst Alchemy,\\ndeficient in such accurate detail, was characterised by a greater degree\\nof philosophical depth and insight; for the alchemists did grasp the\\nfundamental truth of the Cosmos, although they distorted it and made it\\nappear grotesque. The alchemists cast their theories in a mould entirely\\nfantastic, even ridiculous--they drew unwarrantable analogies--and hence\\ntheir views cannot be accepted in these days of modern science. But if\\nwe cannot approve of their theories _in toto_, we can nevertheless\\nappreciate the fundamental ideas at the root of them. And it is\\nprimarily with the object of pointing out this similarity between these\\nancient ideas regarding the physical universe and the latest products\\nof scientific thought, that this book has been written.\\n\\nIt is a regrettable fact that the majority of works dealing with the\\nsubject of Alchemy take a one-sided point of view. The chemists\\ngenerally take a purely physical view of the subject, and instead of\\ntrying to understand its mystical language, often (I do not say always)\\nprefer to label it nonsense and the alchemist a fool. On the other hand,\\nthe mystics, in many cases, take a purely transcendental view of the\\nsubject, forgetting the fact that the alchemists were, for the most\\npart, concerned with operations of a physical nature. For a proper\\nunderstanding of Alchemy, as I hope to make plain in the first chapter\\nof this work, a synthesis of both points of view is essential; and,\\nsince these two aspects are so intimately and essentially connected with\\none another, this is necessary even when, as in the following work, one\\nis concerned primarily with the physical, rather than the purely\\nmystical, aspect of the subject.\\n\\nNow, the author of this book may lay claim to being a humble student of\\nboth Chemistry and what may be generalised under the terms Mysticism and\\nTranscendentalism; and he hopes that this perhaps rather unusual\\ncombination of studies has enabled him to take a broad-minded view of\\nthe theories of the alchemists, and to adopt a sympathetic attitude\\ntowards them.\\n\\nWith regard to the illustrations, the author must express his thanks to\\nthe authorities of the British Museum for permission to photograph\\nengraved portraits and illustrations from old works in the British\\nMuseum Collections, and to G.

Alchemy\\nwas both a philosophy and an experimental science, and the transmutation\\nof the metals was its end only in that this would give the final proof\\nof the alchemistic hypotheses; in other words, Alchemy, considered from\\nthe physical standpoint, was the attempt to demonstrate experimentally\\non the material plane the validity of a certain philosophical view of\\nthe Cosmos. We see the genuine scientific spirit in the saying of one of\\nthe alchemists: “Would to God .\\xa0.\\xa0. all men might become adepts in our\\nArt--for then gold, the great idol of mankind, would lose its value, and\\nwe should prize it only for its scientific teaching.”[6] Unfortunately,\\nhowever, not many alchemists came up to this ideal; and for the majority\\nof them, Alchemy did mean merely the possibility of making gold cheaply\\nand gaining untold wealth.\\n\\n    [6] “EIRENÆUS PHILALETHES”: _An Open Entrance to the Closed Palace\\n    of the King_ (see _The Hermetic Museum, Restored and Enlarged_,\\n    edited by A. E. Waite, 1893, vol. ii. p. 178).\\n\\n\\nThe Transcendental Theory of Alchemy.\\n\\n§ =2.= By some mystics, however, the opinion has been expressed that\\nAlchemy was not a physical art or science at all, that in no sense was\\nits object the manufacture of material gold, and that its processes were\\nnot carried out on the physical plane. According to this transcendental\\ntheory, Alchemy was concerned with man’s soul, its object was the\\nperfection, not of material substances, but of man in a spiritual sense.\\nThose who hold this view identify Alchemy with, or at least regard it as\\na branch of, Mysticism, from which it is supposed to differ merely by\\nthe employment of a special language; and they hold that the writings of\\nthe alchemists must not be understood literally as dealing with chemical\\noperations, with furnaces, retorts, alembics, pelicans and the like,\\nwith salt, sulphur, mercury, gold and other material substances, but\\nmust be understood as grand allegories dealing with spiritual truths.\\nAccording to this view, the figure of the transmutation of the “base”\\nmetals into gold symbolised the salvation of man--the transmutation of\\nhis soul into spiritual gold--which was to be obtained by the\\nelimination of evil and the development of good by the grace of God; and\\nthe realisation of which salvation or spiritual transmutation may be\\ndescribed as the New Birth, or that condition of being known as union\\nwith the Divine. It would follow, of course, if this theory were true,\\nthat the genuine alchemists were pure mystics, and hence, that the\\ndevelopment of chemical science was not due to their labours, but to\\npseudo-alchemists who so far misunderstood their writings as to have\\ninterpreted them in a literal sense.\\n\\n\\nFailure of the Transcendental Theory.\\n\\n§ =3.= This theory, however, has been effectively disposed of by Mr.\\nArthur Edward Waite, who points to the lives of the alchemists\\nthemselves in refutation of it. For their lives indisputably prove that\\nthe alchemists were occupied with chemical operations on the physical\\nplane, and that for whatever motive, they toiled to discover a method\\nfor transmuting the commoner metals into actual, material gold. As\\nParacelsus himself says of the true “spagyric physicians,” who were the\\nalchemists of his period: “These do not give themselves up to ease and\\nidleness .\\xa0.\\xa0. But they devote themselves diligently to their labours,\\nsweating whole nights over fiery furnaces. These do not kill the time\\nwith empty talk, but find their delight in their laboratory.”[7] The\\nwritings of the alchemists contain (mixed, however, with much that from\\nthe physical standpoint appears merely fantastic) accurate accounts of\\nmany chemical processes and discoveries, which cannot be explained away\\nby any method of transcendental interpretation. There is not the\\nslightest doubt that chemistry owes its origin to the direct labours of\\nthe alchemists themselves, and not to any who misread their writings.\\n\\n    [7] PARACELSUS: “Concerning the Nature of Things” (see _The Hermetic\\n    and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus_, edited by A. E. Waite, 1894,\\n    vol. i. p. 167).\\n\\n\\nThe Qualifications of the Adept.\\n\\n§ =4.= At the same time, it is quite evident that there is a\\nconsiderable element of Mysticism in the alchemistic doctrines; this has\\nalways been recognised; but, as a general rule, those who have\\napproached the subject from the scientific point of view have considered\\nthis mystical element as of little or no importance. However, there are\\ncertain curious facts which are not satisfactorily explained by a purely\\nphysical theory of Alchemy, and, in our opinion, the recognition of the\\nimportance of this mystical element and of the true relation which\\nexisted between Alchemy and Mysticism is essential for the right\\nunderstanding of the subject. We may notice, in the first place, that\\nthe alchemists always speak of their Art as a Divine Gift, the highest\\nsecrets of which are not to be learnt from any books on the subject; and\\nthey invariably teach that the right mental attitude with regard to God\\nis the first step necessary for the achievement of the _magnum opus_. As\\nsays one alchemist: “In the first place, let every devout and\\nGod-fearing chemist and student of this Art consider that this arcanum\\nshould be regarded, not only as a truly great, but as a most holy Art\\n(seeing that it typifies and shadows out the highest heavenly good).\\nTherefore, if any man desire to reach this great and unspeakable\\nMystery, he must remember that it is obtained not by the might of man,\\nbut by the grace of God, and that not our will or desire, but only the\\nmercy of the Most High, can bestow it upon us. For this reason you must\\nfirst of all cleanse your heart, lift it up to Him alone, and ask of\\nHim this gift in true, earnest, and undoubting prayer. He alone can give\\nand bestow it.”[8] And “Basil Valentine”: “First, there should be the\\ninvocation of God, flowing from the depth of a pure and sincere heart,\\nand a conscience which should be free from all ambition, hypocrisy, and\\nvice, as also from all cognate faults, such as arrogance, boldness,\\npride, luxury, worldly vanity, oppression of the poor, and similar\\niniquities, which should all be rooted up out of the heart--that when a\\nman appears before the Throne of Grace, to regain the health of his\\nbody, he may come with a conscience weeded of all tares, and be changed\\ninto a pure temple of God cleansed of all that defiles.”[9]\\n\\n    [8] _The Sophic Hydrolith; or, Water Stone of the Wise_ (see _The\\n    Hermetic Museum_, vol. i. p. 74).\\n\\n    [9] _The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony_ (Mr. A. E. Waite’s\\n    translation, p. 13). See § 41.\\n\\n\\nAlchemistic Language.\\n\\n§ =5.= In the second place, we must notice the nature of alchemistic\\nlanguage. As we have hinted above, and as is at once apparent on opening\\nany alchemistic book, the language of Alchemy is very highly mystical,\\nand there is much that is perfectly unintelligible in a physical sense.\\nIndeed, the alchemists habitually apologise for their vagueness on the\\nplea that such mighty secrets may not be made more fully manifest. It is\\ntrue, of course, that in the days of Alchemy’s degeneracy a good deal of\\npseudo-mystical nonsense was written by the many impostors then\\nabounding, but the mystical style of language is by no means confined to\\nthe later alchemistic writings. It is also true that the alchemists, no\\ndoubt, desired to shield their secrets from vulgar and profane eyes, and\\nhence would necessarily adopt a symbolic language. But it is past belief\\nthat the language of the alchemist was due to some arbitrary plan;\\nwhatever it is to us, it was very real to him. Moreover, this argument\\ncuts both ways, for those, also, who take a transcendental view of\\nAlchemy regard its language as symbolical, although after a different\\nmanner. It is also, to say the least, curious, as Mr. A. E. Waite points\\nout, that this mystical element should be found in the writings of the\\nearlier alchemists, whose manuscripts were not written for publication,\\nand therefore ran no risk of informing the vulgar of the precious\\nsecrets of Alchemy. On the other hand, the transcendental method of\\ntranslation does often succeed in making sense out of what is otherwise\\nunintelligible in the writings of the alchemists. The above-mentioned\\nwriter remarks on this point: “Without in any way pretending to assert\\nthat this hypothesis reduces the literary chaos of the philosophers into\\na regular order, it may be affirmed that it materially elucidates their\\nwritings, and that it is wonderful how contradictions, absurdities, and\\ndifficulties seem to dissolve wherever it is applied.”[10]\\n\\n    [10] ARTHUR EDWARD WAITE: _The Occult Sciences_ (1891), p. 91.\\n\\nThe alchemists’ love of symbolism is also conspicuously displayed in the\\ncurious designs with which certain of their books are embellished. We\\nare not here referring to the illustrations of actual apparatus employed\\nin carrying out the various operations of physical Alchemy, which are\\nnot infrequently found in the works of those alchemists who at the same\\ntime were practical chemists (Glauber, for example), but to pictures\\nwhose meaning plainly lies not upon the surface and whose import is\\nclearly symbolical, whether their symbolism has reference to physical or\\nto spiritual processes. Examples of such symbolic illustrations, many of\\nwhich are highly fantastic, will be found in plates 2, 3, and 4. We\\nshall refer to them again in the course of the present and following\\nchapters.\\n\\n\\nAlchemists of a Mystical Type.\\n\\n§ =6.= We must also notice that, although there cannot be the slightest\\ndoubt that the great majority of alchemists were engaged in problems and\\nexperiments of a physical nature, yet there were a few men included\\nwithin the alchemistic ranks who were entirely, or almost entirely,\\nconcerned with problems of a spiritual nature; Thomas Vaughan, for\\nexample, and Jacob Boehme, who boldly employed the language of Alchemy\\nin the elaboration of his system of mystical philosophy. And\\nparticularly must we notice, as Mr. A. E. Waite has also indicated, the\\nsignificant fact that the Western alchemists make unanimous appeal to\\nHermes Trismegistos as the greatest authority on the art of Alchemy,\\nwhose alleged writings are of an undoubtedly mystical character (see §\\n29). It is clear, that in spite of its apparently physical nature,\\nAlchemy must have been in some way closely connected with Mysticism.\\n\\n\\nThe Meaning of Alchemy.\\n\\n§ =7.= If we are ever to understand the meaning of Alchemy aright we\\nmust look at the subject from the alchemistic point of view. In modern\\ntimes there has come about a divorce between Religion and Science in\\nmen’s minds (though more recently a unifying tendency has set in); but\\nit was otherwise with the alchemists, their religion and their science\\nwere closely united. We have said that “Alchemy was the attempt to\\ndemonstrate experimentally on the material plane the validity of a\\ncertain philosophical view of the Cosmos”; now, this “philosophical view\\nof the Cosmos” was Mysticism. =Alchemy had its origin in the attempt to\\napply, in a certain manner, the principles of Mysticism to the things of\\nthe physical plane=, and was, therefore, of a dual nature, on the one\\nhand spiritual and religious, on the other, physical and material. As\\nthe anonymous author of _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_ (1815)\\nremarks, “The universal chemistry, by which the science of alchemy opens\\nthe knowledge of all nature, being founded on _first principles_ forms\\nanalogy with whatever knowledge is founded on the _same first\\nprinciples_.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. Saint John describes the redemption, or the new\\ncreation of the fallen soul, on the _same first principles_, until the\\nconsummation of the work, in which the Divine tincture transmutes the\\nbase metal of the soul into a perfection, that will pass the fire of\\neternity;”[11] that is to say, Alchemy and the mystical regeneration of\\nman (in this writer’s opinion) are analogous processes on different\\nplanes of being, because they are founded on the same first principles.\\n\\n    [11] F. B.: _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_ (1815), Preface,\\n    p. 3.\\n\\n\\nOpinions of other Writers.\\n\\n§ =8.= We shall here quote the opinions of two modern writers, as to the\\nsignificance of Alchemy; one a mystic, the other a man of science. Says\\nMr. A. E. Waite, “If the authors of the ‘Suggestive Inquiry’ and of\\n‘Remarks on Alchemy and the Alchemists’ [two books putting forward the\\ntranscendental theory] had considered the lives of the symbolists, as\\nwell as the nature of the symbols, their views would have been very much\\nmodified; they would have found that the true method of Hermetic\\ninterpretation lies in a middle course; but the errors which originated\\nwith merely typographical investigations were intensified by a\\nconsideration of the great alchemical theorem, which, _par excellence_,\\nis one of universal development, which acknowledges that every substance\\ncontains undeveloped resources and potentialities, and can be brought\\noutward and forward into perfection. They [the generality of alchemists]\\napplied their theory only to the development of metallic substances from\\na lower to a higher order, but we see by their writings that the grand\\nhierophants of Oriental and Western alchemy alike were continually\\nhaunted by brief and imperfect glimpses of glorious possibilities for\\nman, if the evolution of his nature were accomplished along the lines of\\ntheir theory.”[12] Mr. M. M. Pattison Muir, M.A., says: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. alchemy\\naimed at giving experimental proof of a certain theory of the whole\\nsystem of nature, including humanity. The practical culmination of the\\nalchemical quest presented a threefold aspect; the alchemists sought the\\nstone of wisdom, for by gaining that they gained the control of wealth;\\nthey sought the universal panacea, for that would give them the power of\\nenjoying wealth and life; they sought the soul of the world, for thereby\\nthey could hold communion with spiritual existences, and enjoy the\\nfruition of spiritual life. The object of their search was to satisfy\\ntheir material needs, their intellectual capacities, and their spiritual\\nyearnings. The alchemists of the nobler sort always made the first of\\nthese objects subsidiary to the other two. .\\xa0.\\xa0.”[13]\\n\\n    [12] ARTHUR EDWARD WAITE: _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_\\n    (1888), pp. 30, 31. As says another writer of the mystical school of\\n    thought: “If we look upon the subject [of Alchymy] from the point\\n    which affords the widest view, it may be said that Alchymy has two\\n    aspects: the simply material, and the religious. The dogma that\\n    Alchymy was only a form of chemistry is untenable by any one who has\\n    read the works of its chief professors. The doctrine that Alchymy\\n    was religion only, and that its chemical references were all blinds,\\n    is equally untenable in the face of history, which shows that many\\n    of its most noted professors were men who had made important\\n    discoveries in the domain of common chemistry, and were in no way\\n    notable as teachers either of ethics or religion” (“Sapere Aude,”\\n    _The Science of Alchymy, Spiritual and Material_ (1893), pp. 3 and\\n    4).\\n\\n    [13] M. M. PATTISON MUIR, M.A.: _The Story of Alchemy and the\\n    Beginnings of Chemistry_ (1902), pp. 105 and 106.\\n\\n\\nThe Basic Idea of Alchemy.\\n\\n§ =9.= The famous axiom beloved by every alchemist--“_What is above is\\nas that which is below, and what is below is as that which is\\nabove_”--although of questionable origin, tersely expresses the basic\\nidea of Alchemy. The alchemists postulated and believed in a very real\\nsense in the essential unity of the Cosmos. Hence, they held that there\\nis a correspondence or analogy existing between things spiritual and\\nthings physical, the same laws operating in each realm. As writes\\nSendivogius “.\\xa0.\\xa0. the Sages have been taught of God that this natural\\nworld is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual\\npattern; that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality\\nof its celestial archetype; and that God has created it in imitation of\\nthe spiritual and invisible universe, in order that men might be the\\nbetter enabled to comprehend His heavenly teaching, and the wonders of\\nHis absolute and ineffable power and wisdom. Thus the Sage sees heaven\\nreflected in Nature as in a mirror; and he pursues this Art, not for the\\nsake of gold or silver, but for the love of the knowledge which it\\nreveals; he jealously conceals it from the sinner and the scornful, lest\\nthe mysteries of heaven should be laid bare to the vulgar gaze.”[14]\\n\\n    [14] MICHAEL SENDIVOGIUS: _The New Chemical Light, Pt. II.,\\n    Concerning Sulphur_ (_The Hermetic Museum_, vol. ii. p. 138).\\n\\nThe alchemists held that the metals are one in essence, and spring from\\nthe same seed in the womb of nature, but are not all equally matured and\\nperfect, gold being the highest product of Nature’s powers. In gold, the\\nalchemist saw a picture of the regenerate man, resplendent with\\nspiritual beauty, overcoming all temptations and proof against evil;\\nwhilst he regarded lead--the basest of the metals--as typical of the\\nsinful and unregenerate man, stamped with the hideousness of sin and\\neasily overcome by temptation and evil; for whilst gold withstood the\\naction of fire and all known corrosive liquids (save _aqua regia_\\nalone), lead was most easily acted upon. We are told that the\\nPhilosopher’s Stone, which would bring about the desired grand\\ntransmutation, is of a species with gold itself and purer than the\\npurest; understood in the mystical sense this means that the\\nregeneration of man can be effected only by Goodness itself--in terms of\\nChristian theology, by the Power of the Spirit of Christ. The\\nPhilosopher’s Stone was regarded as symbolical of Christ Jesus, and in\\nthis sense we can understand the otherwise incredible powers attributed\\nto it.\\n\\n\\nThe Law of Analogy.\\n\\n§ =10.= With the theories of physical Alchemy we shall deal at length in\\nthe following chapter, but enough has been said to indicate the analogy\\nexisting, according to the alchemistic view, between the problem of the\\nperfection of the metals, _i.e._, the transmutation of the “base” metals\\ninto gold, and the perfection or transfiguration of spiritual man; and\\nit might also be added, between these problems and that of the\\nperfection of man considered physiologically. To the alchemistic\\nphilosopher these three problems were one: the same problem on different\\nplanes of being; and the solution was likewise one. He who held the key\\nto one problem held the key to all three, provided he understood the\\nanalogy between matter and spirit. The point is not, be it noted,\\nwhether these problems are in reality one and the same; the main\\ndoctrine of analogy, which is, indeed, an essential element in all true\\nmystical philosophy, will, we suppose, meet with general consent; but it\\nwill be contended (and rightly, we think) that the analogies drawn by\\nthe alchemists are fantastic and by no means always correct, though\\npossibly there may be more truth in them than appears at first sight.\\nThe point is not that these analogies are correct, but that they were\\nregarded as such by all true alchemists. Says the author of _The Sophic\\nHydrolith_: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. the practice of this Art enables us to understand,\\nnot merely the marvels of Nature, but the nature of God Himself, in all\\nits unspeakable glory. It shadows forth, in a wonderful manner .\\xa0.\\xa0. all\\nthe articles of the Christian faith, and the reason why man must pass\\nthrough much tribulation and anguish, and fall a prey to death, before\\nhe can rise again to a new life.”[15] A considerable portion of this\\ncurious alchemistic work is taken up in expounding the analogy believed\\nto exist between the Philosopher’s Stone and “the Stone which the\\nbuilders rejected,” Christ Jesus; and the writer concludes: “Thus .\\xa0.\\xa0.\\nI have briefly and simply set forth to you the perfect analogy which\\nexists between our earthly and chemical and the true and heavenly Stone,\\nJesus Christ, whereby we may attain unto certain beatitude and\\nperfection, not only in earthly but also in eternal life.”[16] And\\nlikewise says Peter Bonus: “I am firmly persuaded that any unbeliever\\nwho got truly to know this Art, would straightway confess the truth of\\nour Blessed Religion, and believe in the Trinity and in our Lord Jesus\\nChrist.”[17]\\n\\n    [15] _The Sophic Hydrolith; or, Water Stone of the Wise_ (see _The\\n    Hermetic Museum_, vol. i. p. 88).\\n\\n    [16] _Ibid._ p. 114.\\n\\n    [17] PETER BONUS: _The New Pearl of Great Price_ (Mr. A. E. Waite’s\\n    translation, p. 275).\\n\\n\\nThe Dual Nature of Alchemy.\\n\\n§ =11.= For the most part, the alchemists were chiefly engaged with the\\ncarrying out of the alchemistic theory on the physical plane, _i.e._,\\nwith the attempt to transmute the “base” metals into the “noble” ones;\\nsome for the love of knowledge, but alas! the vast majority for the love\\nof mere wealth. But all who were worthy of the title of “alchemist”\\nrealised at times, more or less dimly, the possibility of the\\napplication of the same methods to man and the glorious result of the\\ntransmutation of man’s soul into spiritual gold. There were a few who\\nhad a clearer vision of this ideal, those who devoted their activities\\nentirely, or almost so, to the attainment of this highest goal of\\nalchemistic philosophy, and concerned themselves little if at all with\\nthe analogous problem on the physical plane. The theory that Alchemy\\noriginated in the attempt to demonstrate the applicability of the\\nprinciples of Mysticism to the things of the physical realm brings into\\nharmony the physical and transcendental theories of Alchemy and the\\nvarious conflicting facts advanced in favour of each. It explains the\\nexistence of the above-mentioned, two very different types of\\nalchemists. It explains the appeal to the works attributed to Hermes,\\nand the presence in the writings of the alchemists of much that is\\nclearly mystical. And finally, it is in agreement with such statements\\nas we have quoted above from _The Sophic Hydrolith_ and elsewhere, and\\nthe general religious tone of the alchemistic writings.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 2.\\n\\nSYMBOLICAL ILLUSTRATION\\n\\nRepresenting the Trinity of Body, Soul and Spirit.\\n\\n[_To face page 15_]\\n\\n\\n“Body, Soul and Spirit.”\\n\\n§ =12.= In accordance with our primary object as stated in the preface,\\nwe shall confine our attention mainly to the physical aspect of Alchemy;\\nbut in order to understand its theories, it appears to us to be\\nessential to realise the fact that Alchemy was an attempted application\\nof the principles of Mysticism to the things of the physical world. The\\nsupposed analogy between man and the metals sheds light on what\\notherwise would be very difficult to understand. It helps to make plain\\nwhy the alchemists attributed moral qualities to the metals--some are\\ncalled “imperfect,” “base”; others are said to be “perfect,” “noble.”\\nAnd especially does it help to explain the alchemistic notions\\nregarding the nature of the metals. The alchemists believed that the\\nmetals were constructed after the manner of man, into whose constitution\\nthree factors were regarded as entering: body, soul, and spirit. As\\nregards man, mystical philosophers generally use these terms as follows:\\n“body” is the outward manifestation and form; “soul” is the inward\\nindividual spirit[18]; and “spirit” is the universal Soul in all men.\\nAnd likewise, according to the alchemists, in the metals, there is the\\n“body” or outward form and properties, “metalline soul” or spirit,[19]\\nand finally, the all-pervading essence of all metals. As writes the\\nauthor of the exceedingly curious tract entitled _The Book of\\nLambspring_: “Be warned and understand truly that two fishes are\\nswimming in our sea,” illustrating his remark by the symbolical picture\\nreproduced in plate 2, and adding in elucidation thereof, “The Sea is\\nthe Body, the two Fishes are Soul and Spirit.”[20] The alchemists,\\nhowever, were not always consistent in their use of the term “spirit.”\\nSometimes (indeed frequently) they employed it to denote merely the more\\nvolatile portions of a chemical substance; at other times it had a more\\ninterior significance.\\n\\n    [18] Which, in virtue of man’s self-consciousness, is, by the grace\\n    of God, immortal.\\n\\n    [19] See the work _Of Natural and Supernatural Things_, attributed\\n    to “Basil Valentine,” for a description of the “spirits” of the\\n    metals in particular.\\n\\n    [20] _The Book of Lambspring_, translated by Nicholas Barnaud\\n    Delphinas (see the _Hermetic Museum_, vol. i. p. 277). This work\\n    contains many other fantastic alchemistic symbolical pictures,\\n    amongst the most curious series in alchemistic literature.\\n\\n\\nAlchemy, Mysticism and Modern Science.\\n\\n§ =13.= We notice the great difference between the alchemistic theory\\nand the views regarding the constitution of matter which have dominated\\nChemistry since the time of Dalton. But at the present time Dalton’s\\ntheory of the chemical elements is undergoing a profound modification.\\nWe do not imply that Modern Science is going back to any such fantastic\\nideas as were held by the alchemists, but we are struck with the\\nremarkable similarity between this alchemistic theory of a soul of all\\nmetals, a one primal element, and modern views regarding the ether of\\nspace. In its attempt to demonstrate the applicability of the\\nfundamental principles of Mysticism to the things of the physical realm\\nAlchemy apparently failed and ended its days in fraud. It appears,\\nhowever, that this true aim of alchemistic art--particularly the\\ndemonstration of the validity of the theory that all the various forms\\nof matter are produced by an evolutionary process from some one primal\\nelement or _quintessence_--is being realised by recent researches in the\\ndomain of physical and chemical science.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nTHE THEORY OF PHYSICAL ALCHEMY\\n\\n\\nSupposed Proofs of Transmutation.\\n\\n§ =14.= It must be borne in mind when reviewing the theories of the\\nalchemists, that there were a number of phenomena known at the time, the\\nsuperficial examination of which would naturally engender a belief that\\nthe transmutation of the metals was a common occurrence. For example,\\nthe deposition of copper on iron when immersed in a solution of a copper\\nsalt (_e.g._, blue vitriol) was naturally concluded to be a\\ntransmutation of iron into copper,[21] although, had the alchemists\\nexamined the residual liquid, they would have found that the two metals\\nhad merely exchanged places; and the fact that white and yellow alloys\\nof copper with arsenic and other substances could be produced, pointed\\nto the possibility of transmuting copper into silver and gold. It was\\nalso known that if water (and this is true of distilled water which does\\nnot contain solid matter in solution) was boiled for some time in a\\nglass flask, some solid, earthy matter was produced; and if water could\\nbe transmuted into earth, surely one metal could be converted into\\nanother.[22] On account of these and like phenomena the alchemists\\nregarded the transmutation of the metals as an experimentally proved\\nfact. Even if they are to be blamed for their superficial observation of\\nsuch phenomena, yet, nevertheless, their labours marked a distinct\\nadvance upon the purely speculative and theoretical methods of the\\nphilosophers preceding them. Whatever their faults, the alchemists\\n_were_ the forerunners of modern experimental science.\\n\\n    [21] Cf. _The Golden Tract concerning the Stone of the Philosophers_\\n    (_The Hermetic Museum_, vol. i. p. 25).\\n\\n    [22] Lavoisier (eighteenth century) proved this apparent\\n    transmutation to be due to the action of the water on the glass\\n    vessel containing it.\\n\\n\\nThe Alchemistic Elements.\\n\\n§ =15.= The alchemists regarded the metals as composite, and granting\\nthis, then the possibility of transmutation is only a logical\\nconclusion. In order to understand the theory of the elements held by\\nthem we must rid ourselves of any idea that it bears any close\\nresemblance to Dalton’s theory of the chemical elements; this is clear\\nfrom what has been said in the preceding chapter. Now, it is a fact of\\nsimple observation that many otherwise different bodies manifest some\\nproperty in common, as, for instance, combustibility. Properties such as\\nthese were regarded as being due to some principle or element common to\\nall bodies exhibiting such properties; thus, combustibility was thought\\nto be due to some elementary principle of combustion--the “sulphur” of\\nthe alchemists and the “phlogiston” of a later period. This is a view\\nwhich _à priori_ appears to be not unlikely; but it is now known that,\\nalthough there are relations existing between the properties of bodies\\nand their constituent chemical elements (and also, it should be noted,\\nthe relative arrangement of the particles of these elements), it is the\\nless obvious properties which enable chemists to determine the\\nconstitution of bodies, and the connection is very far from being of the\\nsimple nature imagined by the alchemists.\\n\\n\\nAristotle’s Views regarding the Elements.\\n\\n§ =16.= For the origin of the alchemistic theory of the elements it is\\nnecessary to go back to the philosophers preceding the alchemists, and\\nit is not improbable that they derived it from some still older source.\\nIt was taught by Empedocles of Agrigent (440 B.C. _circa_), who\\nconsidered that there were four elements--earth, water, air, and fire.\\nAristotle added a fifth, “the ether.” These elements were regarded, not\\nas different kinds of matter, but rather as different forms of the one\\noriginal matter, whereby it manifested different properties. It was\\nthought that to these elements were due the four primary properties of\\ndryness, moistness, warmth, and coldness, each element being supposed to\\ngive rise to two of these properties, dryness and warmth being thought\\nto be due to fire, moistness and warmth to air, moistness and coldness\\nto water, and dryness and coldness to earth. Thus, moist and cold bodies\\n(liquids in general) were said to possess these properties in\\nconsequence of the aqueous element, and were termed “waters,” &c. Also,\\nsince these elements were not regarded as different kinds of matter,\\ntransmutation was thought to be possible, one being convertible into\\nanother, as in the example given above (§ 14).\\n\\n\\nThe Sulphur-Mercury Theory.\\n\\n§ =17.= Coming to the alchemists, we find the view that the metals are\\nall composed of two elementary principles--sulphur and mercury--in\\ndifferent proportions and degrees of purity, well-nigh universally\\naccepted in the earlier days of Alchemy. By these terms “sulphur” and\\n“mercury,” however, must not be understood the common bodies ordinarily\\ndesignated by these names; like the elements of Aristotle, the\\nalchemistic principles were regarded as properties rather than as\\nsubstances, though it must be confessed that the alchemists were by no\\nmeans always clear on this point themselves. Indeed, it is not\\naltogether easy to say exactly what the alchemists did mean by these\\nterms, and the question is complicated by the fact that very frequently\\nthey make mention of different sorts of “sulphur” and “mercury.”\\nProbably, however, we shall not be far wrong in saying that “sulphur”\\nwas generally regarded as the principle of combustion and also of\\ncolour, and was said to be present on account of the fact that most\\nmetals are changed into earthy substances by the aid of fire; and to the\\n“mercury,” the metallic principle _par excellence_, was attributed such\\nproperties as fusibility, malleability and lustre, which were regarded\\nas characteristic of the metals in general. The pseudo-Geber (see § 32)\\nsays that “Sulphur is a fatness of the Earth, by temperate Decoction in\\nthe Mine of the Earth thickened, until it be hardned and made dry.”[23]\\nHe considered an excess of sulphur to be a cause of imperfection in the\\nmetals, and he writes that one of the causes of the corruption of the\\nmetals by fire “is the Inclusion of a burning Sulphuriety in the\\nprofundity of their Substance, diminishing them by Inflamation, and\\nexterminating also into Fume, with extream Consumption, whatsoever\\nArgentvive in them is of good Fixation.”[24] He assumed, further, that\\nthe metals contained an incombustible as well as a combustible sulphur,\\nthe latter sulphur being apparently regarded as an impurity.[25] A later\\nalchemist says that sulphur is “most easily recognised by the vital\\nspirit in animals, the colour in metals, the odour in plants.”[26]\\nMercury, on the other hand, according to the pseudo-Geber, is the cause\\nof perfection in the metals, and endows gold with its lustre. Another\\nalchemist, quoting Arnold de Villanova, writes: “Quicksilver is the\\nelementary form of all things fusible; for all things fusible, when\\nmelted, are changed into it, and it mingles with them because it is of\\nthe same substance with them. Such bodies differ from quicksilver in\\ntheir composition only so far as itself is or is not free from the\\nforeign matter of impure sulphur.”[27] The obtaining of “philosophical\\nmercury,” the imaginary virtues of which the alchemists never tired of\\nrelating, was generally held to be essential for the attainment of the\\n_magnum opus_. It was commonly thought that it could be prepared from\\nordinary quicksilver by purificatory processes, whereby the impure\\nsulphur supposed to be present in this sort of mercury might be purged\\naway.\\n\\n    [23] _Of the Sum of Perfection_ (see _The Works of Geber_,\\n    translated by Richard Russel, 1678, pp. 69 and 70).\\n\\n    [24] _Of the Sum of Perfection_ (see _The Works of Geber_, p. 156).\\n\\n    [25] See _The Works of Geber_, p. 160. This view was also held by\\n    other alchemists.\\n\\n    [26] _The New Chemical Light_, Part II., _Concerning Sulphur_ (see\\n    _The Hermetic Museum_, vol. ii. p. 151).\\n\\n    [27] See _The Golden Tract concerning the Stone of the Philosophers_\\n    (_The Hermetic Museum_, vol. i. p. 17).\\n\\nThe sulphur-mercury theory of the metals was held by such famous\\nalchemists as Roger Bacon, Arnold de Villanova and Raymond Lully. Until\\nrecently it was thought to have originated to a great extent with the\\nArabian alchemist, Geber; but the late Professor Berthelot showed that\\nthe works ascribed to Geber, in which the theory is put forward, are\\nforgeries of a date by which it was already centuries old (see § 32).\\nOccasionally, arsenic was regarded as an elementary principle (this view\\nis to be found, for example, in the work _Of the Sum of Perfection_, by\\nthe pseudo-Geber), but the idea was not general.\\n\\n\\nThe Sulphur-Mercury-Salt Theory.\\n\\n§ =18.= Later in the history of Alchemy, the mercury-sulphur theory was\\nextended by the addition of a third elementary principle, salt. As in\\nthe case of philosophical sulphur and mercury, by this term was not\\nmeant common salt (sodium chloride) or any of those substances commonly\\nknown as salts. “Salt” was the name given to a supposed basic principle\\nin the metals, a principle of fixity and solidification, conferring the\\nproperty of resistance to fire. In this extended form, the theory is\\nfound in the works of Isaac of Holland and in those attributed to “Basil\\nValentine,” who (see the work _Of Natural and Supernatural Things_)\\nattempts to explain the differences in the properties of the metals as\\nthe result of the differences in the proportion of sulphur, salt, and\\nmercury they contain. Thus, copper, which is highly coloured, is said to\\ncontain much sulphur, whilst iron is supposed to contain an excess of\\nsalt, &c. The sulphur-mercury-salt theory was vigorously championed by\\nParacelsus, and the doctrine gained very general acceptance amongst the\\nalchemists. Salt, however, seems generally to have been considered a\\nless important principle than either mercury or sulphur.\\n\\nThe same germ-idea underlying these doctrines is to be found much later\\nin Stahl’s phlogistic theory (eighteenth century), which attempted to\\naccount for the combustibility of bodies by the assumption that such\\nbodies all contain “phlogiston”--the hypothetical principle of\\ncombustion (see § 72)--though the concept of “phlogiston” approaches\\nmore nearly to the modern idea of an element than do the alchemistic\\nelements or principles. It was not until still later in the history of\\nChemistry that it became quite evident that the more obvious properties\\nof chemical substances are not specially conferred on them in virtue of\\ncertain elements entering into their constitution.\\n\\n\\nAlchemistic Elements and Principles.\\n\\n§ =19.= The alchemists combined the above theories with Aristotle’s\\ntheory of the elements. The latter, namely, earth, air, fire and water,\\nwere regarded as more interior, more primary, than the principles, whose\\nsource was said to be these same elements. As writes Sendivogius in Part\\nII. of _The New Chemical Light_: “The three Principles of things are\\nproduced out of the four elements in the following manner: Nature, whose\\npower is in her obedience to the Will of God, ordained from the very\\nbeginning, that the four elements should incessantly act on one another\\nso, in obedience to her behest, fire began to act on air, and produced\\nSulphur; air acted on water, and produced Mercury; water, by its action\\non the earth, produced Salt. Earth, alone, having nothing to act upon,\\ndid not produce anything, but became the nurse, or womb, of these three\\nPrinciples. We designedly speak of three Principles; for though the\\nAncients mention only two, it is clear that they omitted the third\\n(Salt) not from ignorance, but from a desire to lead the uninitiated\\nastray.”[28]\\n\\n    [28] _The New Chemical Light_, Part II., _Concerning Sulphur_ (see\\n    _The Hermetic Museum_, vol. ii. pp. 142-143).\\n\\nBeneath and within all these coverings of outward properties, taught the\\nalchemists, is hidden the secret essence of all material things. “.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\nthe elements and compounds,” writes one alchemist, “in addition to crass\\nmatter, are composed of a subtle substance, or intrinsic radical\\nhumidity, diffused through the elemental parts, simple and wholly\\nincorruptible, long preserving the things themselves in vigour, and\\ncalled the Spirit of the World, proceeding from the Soul of the World,\\nthe one certain life, filling and fathoming all things, gathering\\ntogether and connecting all things, so that from the three genera of\\ncreatures, Intellectual, Celestial, and Corruptible, there is formed the\\nOne Machine of the whole world.”[29] It is hardly necessary to point out\\nhow nearly this approaches modern views regarding the Ether of Space.\\n\\n    [29] ALEXANDER VON SUCHTEN: _Man, the best and most perfect of God’s\\n    creatures. A more complete Exposition of this Medical Foundation for\\n    the less Experienced Student._ (See BENEDICTUS FIGULUS: _A Golden\\n    and Blessed Casket of Nature’s Marvels_, translated by A. E. Waite,\\n    1893, pp. 71 and 72.)\\n\\n\\nThe Growth of the Metals.\\n\\n§ =20.= The alchemists regarded the metals as growing in the womb of the\\nearth, and a knowledge of this growth as being of very great importance.\\nThomas Norton (who, however, contrary to the generality of alchemists,\\ndenied that metals have seed and that they grow in the sense of\\nmultiply) says:--\\n\\n    “_Mettalls_ of kinde grow lowe under ground,\\n    For above erth rust in them is found;\\n    Soe above erth appeareth corruption,\\n    Of mettalls, and in long tyme destruction,\\n    Whereof noe Cause is found in this Case,\\n    Buth that above Erth thei be not in their place\\n    Contrarie places to nature causeth strife\\n    As Fishes out of water losen their Lyfe:\\n    And Man, with Beasts, and Birds live in ayer,\\n    But Stones and Mineralls under Erth repaier.”[30]\\n\\n    [30] THOMAS NORTON: _Ordinall of Alchemy_ (see _Theatrum Chemicum\\n    Britannicum_, edited by Elias Ashmole, 1652, p. 18).\\n\\nNorton here expresses the opinion, current among the alchemists, that\\neach and every thing has its own peculiar environment natural to it; a\\nview controverted by Robert Boyle (§ 71). So firm was the belief in the\\ngrowth of metals, that mines were frequently closed for a while in order\\nthat the supply of metal might be renewed. The fertility of Mother Earth\\nforms the subject of one of the illustrations in _The Twelve Keys_ of\\n“Basil Valentine” (see § 41). We reproduce it in plate 3, fig. A.\\nRegarding this subject, the author writes: “The quickening power of the\\nearth produces all things that grow forth from it, and he who says that\\nthe earth has no life makes a statement which is flatly contradicted by\\nthe most ordinary facts. For what is dead cannot produce life and\\ngrowth, seeing that it is devoid of the quickening spirit. This spirit\\nis the life and soul that dwell in the earth, and are nourished by\\nheavenly and sidereal influences. For all herbs, trees, and roots, and\\nall metals and minerals, receive their growth and nutriment from the\\nspirit of the earth, which is the spirit of life. This spirit is itself\\nfed by the stars, and is thereby rendered capable of imparting nutriment\\nto all things that grow, and of nursing them as a mother does her child\\nwhile it is yet in the womb. The minerals are hidden in the womb of the\\nearth, and nourished by her with the spirit which she receives from\\nabove.\\n\\n“Thus the power of growth that I speak of is imparted not by the earth,\\nbut by the life-giving spirit that is in it. If the earth were deserted\\nby this spirit, it would be dead, and no longer able to afford\\nnourishment to anything. For its sulphur or richness would lack the\\nquickening spirit without which there can be neither life nor\\ngrowth.”[31]\\n\\n    [31] “BASIL VALENTINE”: _The Twelve Keys_ (see _The Hermetic\\n    Museum_, vol. i. pp. 333-334).\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 3.\\n\\nA.\\n\\nSYMBOLICAL ILLUSTRATION\\n\\nRepresenting the Fertility of the Earth.\\n\\nB.\\n\\nSYMBOLICAL ILLUSTRATION\\n\\nRepresenting the Amalgamation of Gold with Mercury.\\n\\n(See page 33.)\\n\\n_To face page 26_]]\\n\\n\\nAlchemy and Astrology.\\n\\n§ =21.= The idea that the growth of each metal was under the influence\\nof one of the heavenly bodies (a theory in harmony with the alchemistic\\nview of the unity of the Cosmos), was very generally held by the\\nalchemists; and in consequence thereof, the metals were often referred\\nto by the names or astrological symbols of their peculiar planets. These\\nparticulars are shown in the following table:--\\n\\n  -----------+----------------------+--------------\\n  Metals.    |   Planets, &c.[32]   |   Symbols.\\n  -----------+----------------------+--------------\\n  Gold       |        Sun           |      ☉\\n  Silver     |        Moon          |      ☽\\n  Mercury    |        Mercury       |      ☿\\n  Copper     |        Venus         |      ♀\\n  Iron       |        Mars          |      ♂\\n  Tin        |        Jupiter       |      ♃\\n  Lead       |        Saturn        |      ♄\\n  -----------+----------------------+--------------\\n\\nMoreover, it was thought by some alchemists that a due observance of\\nastrological conditions was necessary for successfully carrying out\\nimportant alchemistic experiments.\\n\\n    [32] This supposed connection between the metals and planets also\\n    played an important part in Talismanic Magic.\\n\\n\\nAlchemistic View of the Nature of Gold.\\n\\n§ =22.= The alchemists regarded gold as the most perfect metal, silver\\nbeing considered more perfect than the rest. The reason of this view is\\nnot difficult to understand: gold is the most beautiful of all the\\nmetals, and it retains its beauty without tarnishing; it resists the\\naction of fire and most corrosive liquids, and is unaffected by sulphur;\\nit was regarded, as we have pointed out above (see § 9), as symbolical\\nof the regenerate man. Silver, on the other hand, is, indeed, a\\nbeautiful metal which wears well in a pure atmosphere and resists the\\naction of fire; but it is attacked by certain corrosives (_e.g._, _aqua\\nfortis_ or nitric acid) and also by sulphur. Through all the metals,\\nfrom the one seed, Nature, according to the alchemists, works\\ncontinuously up to gold; so that, in a sense, all other metals are gold\\nin the making; their existence marks the staying of Nature’s powers; as\\n“Eirenæus Philalethes” says: “All metallic seed is the seed of gold; for\\ngold is the intention of Nature in regard to all metals. If the base\\nmetals are not gold, it is only through some accidental hindrance; they\\nare all potentially gold.”[33] Or, as another alchemist puts it: “Since\\n.\\xa0.\\xa0. the substance of the metals is _one_, and common to all, and since\\nthis substance is (either at once, or after laying aside in course of\\ntime the foreign and evil sulphur of the baser metals by a process of\\ngradual digestion) changed by the virtue of its own indwelling sulphur\\ninto GOLD, which is the goal of all the metals, and the true intention\\nof Nature--we are obliged to admit, and freely confess that in the\\nmineral kingdom, as well as in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, Nature\\nseeks and demands a gradual attainment of perfection, and a gradual\\napproximation to the highest standard of purity and excellence.”[34]\\nSuch was the alchemistic view of the generation of the metals; a theory\\nwhich is admittedly crude, but which, nevertheless, contains the germ of\\na great principle of the utmost importance, namely, the idea that all\\nthe varying forms of matter are evolved from some one primordial\\nstuff--a principle of which chemical science lost sight for awhile, for\\nits validity was unrecognised by Dalton’s Atomic Theory (at least, as\\nenunciated by him), but which is being demonstrated, as we hope to show\\nhereinafter, by recent scientific research. The alchemist was certainly\\na fantastic evolutionist, but he _was_ an evolutionist, and, moreover,\\nhe did not make the curious and paradoxical mistake of regarding the\\nfact of evolution as explaining away the existence of God--the alchemist\\nrecognised the hand of the Divine in nature--and, although, in these\\ndays of modern science, we cannot accept his theory of the growth of\\nmetals, we can, nevertheless, appreciate and accept the fundamental\\ngerm-idea underlying it.\\n\\n    [33] “EIRENÆUS PHILALETHES”: _The Metamorphosis of Metals_ (see _The\\n    Hermetic Museum_, vol. ii. p. 239).\\n\\n    [34] _The Golden Tract Concerning the Stone of the Philosophers_\\n    (see _The Hermetic Museum_, vol. i. p. 19).\\n\\n\\nThe Philosopher’s Stone.\\n\\n§ =23.= The alchemist strove to assist Nature in her gold-making, or, at\\nleast, to carry out her methods. The pseudo-Geber taught that the\\nimperfect metals were to be perfected or cured by the application of\\n“medicines.” Three forms of medicines were distinguished; the first\\nbring about merely a temporary change, and the changes wrought by the\\nsecond class, although permanent, are not complete. “A Medicine of the\\nthird Order,” he writes, “I call every Preparation, which, when it comes\\nto Bodies, with its projection, takes away all Corruption, and perfects\\nthem with the Difference of all Compleatment. But this is one only.”[35]\\nThis, the true medicine that would produce a real and permanent\\ntransmutation, is the =Philosopher’s Stone=, the Masterpiece of\\nalchemistic art. Similar views were held by all the alchemists, though\\nsome of them taught that it was necessary first of all to reduce the\\nmetals to their first substance. Often, two forms of the Philosopher’s\\nStone were distinguished, or perhaps we should say, two degrees of\\nperfection in the one Stone; that for transmuting the “imperfect” metals\\ninto silver being said to be white, the stone or “powder of projection”\\nfor gold being said to be of a red colour. In other accounts (see\\nChapter V.) the medicine is described as of a pale brimstone hue.\\n\\n    [35] _Of the Sum of Perfection_ (see _The Works of Geber_,\\n    translated by Richard Russel, 1678, p. 192).\\n\\nMost of the alchemists who claimed knowledge of the Philosopher’s Stone\\nor the _materia prima_ necessary for its preparation, generally kept its\\nnature most secret, and spoke only in the most enigmatical and\\nallegorical language, the majority of their recipes containing words of\\nunknown meaning. In some cases gold or silver, as the case may be, was\\nemployed in preparing the “medicine”; and, after projection had been\\nmade, this was, of course, obtained again in the metallic form, the\\nalchemist imagining that a transmutation had been effected. In the case\\nof the few other recipes that are intelligible, the most that could be\\nobtained by following out their instructions is a white or yellow\\nmetallic alloy superficially resembling silver or gold.\\n\\n\\nThe Nature of the Philosopher’s Stone.\\n\\n§ =24.= The mystical as distinguished from the pseudo-practical\\ndescriptions of the Stone and its preparation are by far the more\\ninteresting of the two. Paracelsus, in his work on _The Tincture of the\\nPhilosophers_, tells us that all that is necessary for us to do is to\\nmix and coagulate the “rose-coloured blood from the Lion” and “the\\ngluten from the Eagle,” by which he probably meant that we must combine\\n“philosophical sulphur” with “philosophical mercury.” This opinion,\\nthat the Philosopher’s Stone consists of “philosophical sulphur and\\nmercury” combined so as to constitute a perfect unity, was commonly held\\nby the alchemists, and they frequently likened this union to the\\nconjunction of the sexes in marriage. “Eirenæus Philalethes” tells us\\nthat for the preparation of the Stone it is necessary to extract the\\nseed of gold, though this cannot be accomplished by subjecting gold to\\ncorrosive liquids, but only by a homogeneous water (or liquid)--the\\nMercury of the Sages. In the _Book of the Revelation of Hermes,\\ninterpreted by Theophrastus Paracelsus, concerning the Supreme Secret of\\nthe World_, the Medicine, which is here, as not infrequently, identified\\nwith the alchemistic essence of all things or Soul of the World, is\\ndescribed in the following suggestive language: “This is the Spirit of\\nTruth, which the world cannot comprehend without the interposition of\\nthe Holy Ghost, or without the instruction of those who know it. The\\nsame is of a mysterious nature, wondrous strength, boundless power.\\n.\\xa0.\\xa0. By Avicenna this Spirit is named the Soul of the World. For, as\\nthe Soul moves all the limbs of the Body, so also does this Spirit move\\nall bodies. And as the Soul is in all the limbs of the Body, so also is\\nthis Spirit in all elementary created things. It is sought by many and\\nfound by few. It is beheld from afar and found near; for it exists in\\nevery thing, in every place, and at all times. It has the powers of all\\ncreatures; its action is found in all elements, and the qualities of all\\nthings are therein, even in the highest perfection .\\xa0.\\xa0. it heals all\\ndead and living bodies without other medicine, .\\xa0.\\xa0. converts all\\nmetallic bodies into gold, and there is nothing like unto it under\\nHeaven.”[36]\\n\\n    [36] See BENEDICTUS FIGULUS: _A Golden and Blessed Casket of\\n    Nature’s Marvels_ (translated by A. E. Waite, 1893, pp. 36, 37, and\\n    41).\\n\\n\\nThe Theory of Development.\\n\\n§ =25.= From the ascetic standpoint (and unfortunately, most mystics\\nhave been somewhat overfond of ascetic ideas), the development of the\\nsoul is only fully possible with the mortification of the body; and all\\ntrue Mysticism teaches that if we would reach the highest goal possible\\nfor man--union with the Divine--there must be a giving up of our own\\nindividual wills, an abasement of the soul before the Spirit. And so the\\nalchemists taught that for the achievement of the _magnum opus_ on the\\nphysical plane, we must strip the metals of their outward properties in\\norder to develop the essence within. As says Helvetius: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. the\\nessences of metals are hidden in their outward bodies, as the kernel is\\nhidden in the nut. Every earthly body, whether animal, vegetable, or\\nmineral, is the habitation and terrestrial abode of that celestial\\nspirit, or influence, which is its principle of life or growth. The\\nsecret of Alchemy is the destruction of the body, which enables the\\nArtist to get at, and utilise for his own purposes, the living\\nsoul.”[37] This killing of the outward nature of material things was to\\nbe brought about by the processes of putrefaction and decay; hence the\\nreason why such processes figure so largely in alchemistic recipes for\\nthe preparation of the “Divine Magistery.” It must be borne in mind,\\nhowever, that the alchemists used the terms “putrefaction” and “decay”\\nrather indiscriminately, applying them to chemical processes which are\\nno longer regarded as such. Pictorial symbols of death and decay\\nrepresentative of such processes are to be found in several alchemistic\\nbooks. There is a curious series of pictures in _A Form and Method of\\nPerfecting Base Metals_, by Janus Lacinus, the Calabrian (a short tract\\nprefixed to _The New Pearl of Great Price_ by Peter Bonus--see § 39), of\\nwhich we show three examples in plates 3 and 4. In the first picture of\\nthe series (not shown here) we enter the palace of the king (gold) and\\nobserve him sitting crowned upon his throne, surrounded by his son\\n(mercury) and five servants (silver, copper, tin, iron and lead). In the\\nnext picture (plate 3, fig. B), the son, incited by the servants, kills\\nhis father; and, in the third, he catches the blood of his murdered\\nparent in his robes; whereby we understand that an amalgam of gold and\\nmercury is to be prepared, the gold apparently disappearing or dying,\\nwhilst the mercury is coloured thereby. The next picture shows us a\\ngrave being dug, _i.e._, a furnace is to be made ready. In the fifth\\npicture in the series, the son “thought to throw his father into the\\ngrave, and to leave him there; but .\\xa0.\\xa0. both fell in together”; and in\\nthe sixth picture (plate 4, fig. A), we see the son being prevented from\\nescaping, both son and father being left in the grave to decay. Here we\\nhave instructions in symbolical form to place the amalgam in a sealed\\nvessel in the furnace and to allow it to remain there until some change\\nis observed. So the allegory proceeds. Ultimately the father is\\nrestored to life, the symbol of resurrection being (as might be\\nexpected) of frequent occurrence in alchemistic literature. By this\\nresurrection we understand that the gold will finally be obtained in a\\npure form. Indeed, it is now the “great medicine” and, in the last\\npicture of the series (plate 4, fig. B), the king’s son and his five\\nservants are all made kings in virtue of its powers.\\n\\n    [37] J. F. HELVETIUS: _The Golden Calf_, ch. iv.

This claim of the alchemists, that a most minute\\nquantity of the Stone was sufficient to transmute considerable\\nquantities of “base” metal, has been the object of much ridicule.\\nCertainly, some of the claims of the alchemists (understood literally)\\nare out of all reason; but on the other hand, the disproportion between\\nthe quantities of Stone and transmuted metal cannot be advanced as an _à\\npriori_ objection to the alchemists’ claims, inasmuch that a class of\\nchemical reactions (called “catalytic”) is known, in which the presence\\nof a small quantity of some appropriate form of matter--the\\ncatalyst--brings about a chemical change in an indefinite quantity of\\nsome other form or forms; thus, for example, cane-sugar in aqueous\\nsolution is converted into two other sugars by the action of small\\nquantities of acid; and sulphur-dioxide and oxygen, which will not\\ncombine under ordinary conditions, do so readily in the presence of a\\nsmall quantity of platinized asbestos, which is obtained unaltered\\nafter the reaction is completed and may be used over and over again\\n(this process is actually employed in the manufacture of sulphuric acid\\nor oil of vitriol). However, whether any such catalytic transmutation of\\nthe chemical “elements” is possible is merely conjecture.\\n\\n\\nThe Elixir of Life.\\n\\n§ =27.= The Elixir of Life, which was generally described as a solution\\nof the Stone in spirits of wine, or identified with the Stone itself,\\ncould be applied, so it was thought, under certain conditions to the\\nalchemist himself, with an entirely analogous result, _i.e._, it would\\nrestore him to the flower of youth. The idea, not infrequently\\nattributed to the alchemists, that the Elixir would endow one with a\\nlife of endless duration on the material plane is not in strict accord\\nwith alchemistic analogy. From this point of view, the effect of the\\nElixir is physiological perfection, which, although ensuring long life,\\nis not equivalent to endless life on the material plane. “The\\nPhilosophers’ Stone,” says Paracelsus, “purges the whole body of man,\\nand cleanses it from all impurities by the introduction of new and more\\nyouthful forces which it joins to the nature of man.”[38] And in another\\nwork expressive of the opinions of the same alchemist, we read: “.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\nthere is nothing which might deliver the mortal body from death; but\\nthere is One Thing which may postpone decay, renew youth, and prolong\\nshort human life .\\xa0.\\xa0.”[39] In the theory that a solution of the\\nPhilosopher’s Stone (which, it must be remembered, was thought to be of\\na species with gold) constituted the _Elixir Vitæ_, can be traced,\\nperhaps, the idea that gold in a potable form was a veritable cure-all:\\nin the latter days of Alchemy any yellow-coloured liquid was foisted\\nupon a credulous public as a medicinal preparation of gold.\\n\\n    [38] THEOPHRASTUS PARACELSUS: _The Fifth Book of the Archidoxies_\\n    (see _The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus_,\\n    translated by A.

A and B.--Two forms of Apparatus for Sublimation.\\n\\n_To face page 37_]]\\n\\n\\nThe Practical Methods of the Alchemists.\\n\\n§ =28.= We will conclude this chapter with some few remarks regarding\\nthe practical methods of the alchemists. In their experiments, the\\nalchemists worked with very large quantities of material compared with\\nwhat is employed in chemical researches at the present day. They had\\ngreat belief in the efficacy of time to effect a desired change in their\\nsubstances, and they were wont to repeat the same operation (such as\\ndistillation, for example) on the same material over and over again;\\nwhich demonstrated their unwearied patience, even if it effected little\\ntowards the attainment of their end. They paid much attention to any\\nchanges of colour they observed in their experiments, and many\\ndescriptions of supposed methods to achieve the _magnum opus_ contain\\ndetailed directions as to the various changes of colour which must be\\nobtained in the material operated upon if a successful issue to the\\nexperiment is desired.[40] In plates 5 and 6 we give illustrations of\\nsome characteristic pieces of apparatus employed by the alchemists.\\nPlate 5, fig. A, and plate 6, fig. A, are from a work known as\\n_Alchemiae Gebri_ (1545); plate 5, fig. B, is from Glauber’s work on\\nFurnaces (1651); and plate 6, fig. B, is from a work by Dr. John French\\nentitled _The Art of Distillation_ (1651). The first figure shows us a\\nfurnace and alembics. The alembic proper is a sort of still-head which\\ncan be luted on to a flask or other vessel, and was much used for\\ndistillations. In the present case, however, the alembics are employed\\nin conjunction with apparatus for subliming difficultly volatile\\nsubstances. Plate 5, fig. B, shows another apparatus for sublimation,\\nconsisting of a sort of oven, and three detachable upper chambers,\\ngenerally called aludels. In both forms of apparatus the vapours are\\ncooled in the upper part of the vessel, and the substance is deposited\\nin the solid form, being thereby purified from less volatile impurities.\\nPlate 6, fig. A, shows an athanor (or digesting furnace) and a couple of\\ndigesting vessels. A vessel of this sort was employed for heating bodies\\nin a closed space, the top being sealed up when the substances to be\\noperated upon had been put inside, and the vessel heated in ashes in an\\nathanor, a uniform temperature being maintained. The pelican,\\nillustrated in plate 6, fig. B, was used for a similar purpose, the two\\narms being added in the idea that the vapours would be circulated\\nthereby.\\n\\n    [40] As writes Espagnet in his _Hermetic Arcanum_, canons 64 and 65:\\n    “The Means or demonstrative signs are Colours, successively and\\n    orderly affecting the matter and its affections and demonstrative\\n    passions, whereof there are also three special ones (as critical) to\\n    be noted; to these some add a Fourth. The first is black, which is\\n    called the Crow’s head, because of its extreme blackness, whose\\n    crepusculum sheweth the beginning of the action of the fire of\\n    nature and solution, and the blackest midnight sheweth the\\n    perfection of liquefaction, and confusion of the elements. Then the\\n    grain putrefies and is corrupted, that it may be the more apt for\\n    generation. The white colour succeedeth the black, wherein is given\\n    the perfection of the first degree, and of the White Sulphur. This\\n    is called the blessed stone; this Earth is white and foliated,\\n    wherein Philosophers do sow their gold. The third is Orange colour,\\n    which is produced in the passage of the white to the red, as the\\n    middle, and being mixed of both is as the dawn with his saffron\\n    hair, a forerunner of the Sun. The fourth colour is Ruddy and\\n    Sanguine, which is extracted from the white fire only. Now because\\n    whiteness is easily altered by any other colour before day it\\n    quickly faileth of its candour. But the deep redness of the Sun\\n    perfecteth the work of Sulphur, which is called the Sperm of the\\n    male, the fire of the Stone, the King’s Crown, and the Son of Sol,\\n    wherein the first labour of the workman resteth.\\n\\n    “Besides these decretory signs which firmly inhere in the matter,\\n    and shew its essential mutations, almost infinite colours appear,\\n    and shew themselves in vapours, as the Rainbow in the clouds, which\\n    quickly pass away and are expelled by those that succeed, more\\n    affecting the air than the earth: the operator must have a gentle\\n    care of them, because they are not permanent, and proceed not from\\n    the intrinsic disposition of the matter, but from the fire painting\\n    and fashioning everything after its pleasure, or casually by heat in\\n    slight moisture” (see _Collectanea Hermetica_, edited by W. Wynn\\n    Westcott, vol. i., 1893, pp. 28 and 29). Very probably this is not\\n    without a mystical meaning as well as a supposed application in the\\n    preparation of the physical Stone.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 6.\\n\\nALCHEMISTIC APPARATUS. A.--An Athanor. B.--A Pelican.\\n\\n_To face page 38_]]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nTHE ALCHEMISTS[41]\\n\\n(A. BEFORE PARACELSUS)\\n\\n\\nHermes Trismegistos.\\n\\n§ =29.= Having now considered the chief points in the theory of Physical\\nAlchemy, we must turn our attention to the lives and individual\\nteachings of the alchemists themselves. The first name which is found in\\nthe history of Alchemy is that of =Hermes Trismegistos=. We have already\\nmentioned the high esteem in which the works ascribed to this personage\\nwere held by the alchemists (§ 6). He has been regarded as the father of\\nAlchemy; his name has supplied a synonym for the Art--the Hermetic\\nArt--and even to-day we speak of _hermetically_ sealing flasks and the\\nlike. But who Hermes actually was, or even if there were such a\\npersonage, is a matter of conjecture. The alchemists themselves supposed\\nhim to have been an Egyptian living about the time of Moses. He is now\\ngenerally regarded as purely mythical--a personification of Thoth, the\\nEgyptian God of learning; but, of course, some person or persons must\\nhave written the works attributed to him, and the first of such writers\\n(if, as seems not unlikely, there were more than one) may be considered\\nto have a right to the name. Of these works, the _Divine Pymander_,[42]\\na mystical-religious treatise, is the most important. The _Golden\\nTractate_, also attributed to Hermes, which is an exceedingly obscure\\nalchemistic work, is now regarded as having been written at a\\ncomparatively late date.\\n\\n    [41] It is perhaps advisable to mention here that the lives of the\\n    alchemists, for the most part, are enveloped in considerable\\n    obscurity, and many points in connection therewith are in dispute.\\n    The authorities we have followed will be found, as a rule,\\n    specifically mentioned in what follows; but we may here acknowledge\\n    our general indebtedness to the following works, though, as the\\n    reader will observe, many others have been consulted as well: Thomas\\n    Thomson’s _The History of Chemistry_, Meyer’s _A History of\\n    Chemistry_, the anonymous _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_\\n    (1815), the works of Mr. A. E. Waite, the _Dictionary of National\\n    Biography_, and certain articles in the _Encyclopædia Britannica_.\\n    This must not be taken to mean, however, that we have always\\n    followed the conclusions reached in these works, for so far as the\\n    older of them are concerned, recent researches by various\\n    authorities--to whom reference will be found in the following pages,\\n    and to whom, also, we are indebted--have shown, in certain cases,\\n    that such are not tenable.\\n\\n    [42] Dr. Everard’s translation of this work forms vol. ii. of the\\n    _Collectanea Hermetica_, edited by W. Wynn Westcott, M.B., D.P.H. It\\n    is now, however, out of print.\\n\\n\\nThe Smaragdine Table.\\n\\n§ =30.= In a work attributed to Albertus Magnus, but which is probably\\nspurious, we are told that Alexander the Great found the tomb of Hermes\\nin a cave near Hebron. This tomb contained an emerald table--“The\\nSmaragdine Table”--on which were inscribed the following thirteen\\nsentences in Phœnician characters:--\\n\\n1. I speak not fictitious things, but what is true and most certain.\\n\\n2. What is below is like that which is above, and what is above is like\\nthat which is below, to accomplish the miracles of one thing.\\n\\n3. And as all things were produced by the mediation of one Being, so all\\nthings were produced from this one thing by adaptation.\\n\\n4. Its father is the Sun, its mother the Moon; the wind carries it in\\nits belly, its nurse is the earth.\\n\\n5. It is the cause of all perfection throughout the whole world.\\n\\n6. Its power is perfect if it be changed into earth.\\n\\n7. Separate the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross, acting\\nprudently and with judgment.\\n\\n8. Ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven, and then\\nagain descend to the earth, and unite together the powers of things\\nsuperior and things inferior. Thus you will obtain the glory of the\\nwhole world, and all obscurity will fly far away from you.\\n\\n9. This thing is the fortitude of all fortitude, because it overcomes\\nall subtle things, and penetrates every solid thing.\\n\\n10. Thus were all things created.\\n\\n11. Thence proceed wonderful adaptations which are produced in this way.\\n\\n12. Therefore am I called Hermes Trismegistos, possessing the three\\nparts of the philosophy of the whole world.\\n\\n13. That which I had to say concerning the operation of the Sun is\\ncompleted.\\n\\nThese sentences clearly teach the doctrine of the alchemistic essence or\\n“One Thing,” which is everywhere present, penetrating even solids (this\\nwe should note is true of the ether of space), and out of which all\\nthings of the physical world are made by adaptation or modification. The\\nterms Sun and Moon in the above passage probably stand for Spirit and\\nMatter respectively, not gold and silver.\\n\\n\\nZosimus of Panopolis.\\n\\n§ =31.= One of the earliest of the alchemists of whom record remains was\\n=Zosimus of Panopolis=, who flourished in the fifth century, and was\\nregarded by the later alchemists as a master of the Art. He is said to\\nhave written many treatises dealing with Alchemy, but only fragments\\nremain. Of these fragments, Professor Venable says: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. they give us\\na good idea of the learning of the man and of his times. They contain\\ndescriptions of apparatus, of furnaces, studies of minerals, of alloys,\\nof glass making, of mineral waters, and much that is mystical, besides a\\ngood deal referring to the transmutation of metals.”[43] Zosimus is said\\nto have been the author of the saying, “like begets like,” but whether\\nall the fragments ascribed to him were really his work is doubtful.\\n\\n    [43] F. P. VENABLE, Ph.D.: _A Short History of Chemistry_ (1896), p.\\n    13.\\n\\nAmong other early alchemists we may mention also =Africanus=, the\\nSyrian; =Synesius=, Bishop of Ptolemais, and the historian,\\n=Olympiodorus= of Thebes.\\n\\n\\nGeber.\\n\\n§ =32.= In the seventh century the Arabians conquered Egypt; and\\nstrangely enough, Alchemy flourished under them to a remarkable degree.\\nOf all the Arabian alchemists, =Geber= has been regarded as the\\ngreatest; as Professor Meyer says: “There can be no dispute that with\\nthe name _Geber_ was propagated the memory of a personality with which\\nthe chemical knowledge of the time was bound up.”[44] Geber is supposed\\nto have lived about the ninth century, but of his life nothing definite\\nis known. A large number of works have been ascribed to him, of which\\nthe majority are unknown, but the four Latin MSS. which have been\\nprinted under the titles _Summa Perfectionis Mettalorum_, _De\\nInvestigatione Perfectionis Metallorum_, _De Inventione Veritatis_ and\\n_De Fornacibus Construendis_, were, until a few years ago, regarded as\\ngenuine. On the strength of these works, Geber has ranked high as a\\nchemist. In them are described the preparation of many important\\nchemical compounds; the most essential chemical operations, such as\\nsublimation, distillation, filtration, crystallisation (or coagulation,\\nas the alchemists called it), &c.; and also important chemical\\napparatus, for example, the water-bath, improved furnaces, &c. However,\\nit was shown by the late Professor Berthelot that _Summa Perfectionis\\nMettalorum_ is a forgery of the fourteenth century, and the other works\\nforgeries of an even later date. Moreover, the original Arabic MSS. of\\nGeber have been brought to light. These true writings of Geber are very\\nobscure; they give no warrant for believing that the famous\\nsulphur-mercury theory was due to this alchemist, and they prove him not\\nto be the expert chemist that he was supposed to have been. The spurious\\nwritings mentioned above show that the pseudo-Geber was a man of wide\\nchemical knowledge and experience, and play a not inconsiderable part in\\nthe history of Alchemy.\\n\\n    [44] ERNST VON MEYER: _A History of Chemistry_ (translated by Dr.\\n    McGowan, 1906), p. 31.\\n\\n\\nOther Arabian Alchemists.\\n\\n§ =33.= Among other Arabian alchemists the most celebrated were\\n=Avicenna= and =Rhasis=, who are supposed to have lived some time after\\nGeber; and to whom, perhaps, the sulphur-mercury theory may have been to\\nsome extent due.\\n\\nThe teachings of the Arabian alchemists gradually penetrated into the\\nWestern world, in which, during the thirteenth century, flourished some\\nof the most eminent of the alchemists, whose lives and teachings we must\\nnow briefly consider.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 7.\\n\\n[by de Bry]\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF ALBERTUS MAGNUS.\\n\\n_To face page 44_]]\\n\\n\\nAlbertus Magnus (1193-1280).\\n\\n§ =34.= =Albertus Magnus=, Albert Groot or Albert von Bollstädt (see\\nplate 7), was born at Lauingen, probably in 1193. He was educated at\\nPadua, and in his later years he showed himself apt at acquiring the\\nknowledge of his time. He studied theology, philosophy and natural\\nscience, and is chiefly celebrated as an Aristotelean philosopher. He\\nentered the Dominican order, taught publicly at Cologne, Paris and\\nelsewhere, and was made provincial of this order. Later he had the\\nbishopric of Regensburg conferred on him, but he retired after a few\\nyears to a Dominican cloister, where he devoted himself to philosophy\\nand science. He was one of the most learned men of his time and,\\nmoreover, a man of noble character. The authenticity of the alchemistic\\nworks attributed to him has been questioned.\\n\\n\\nThomas Aquinas (1225-1274).\\n\\n§ =35.= The celebrated Dominican, =Thomas Aquinas= (see plate 8), was\\nprobably a pupil of Albertus Magnus, from whom it is thought he imbibed\\nalchemistic learning. It is very probable, however, that the alchemistic\\nworks attributed to him are spurious. The author of these works\\nmanifests a deeply religious tone, and, according to Thomson’s _History\\nof Chemistry_, he was the first to employ the term “amalgam” to\\ndesignate an alloy of mercury with some other metal.[45]\\n\\n    [45] THOMAS THOMSON: _The History of Chemistry_, vol. i. (1830), p.\\n    33.\\n\\n\\nRoger Bacon (1214-1294).\\n\\n§ =36.= =Roger Bacon=, the most illustrious of the mediæval alchemists,\\nwas born near Ilchester in Somerset, probably in 1214. His erudition,\\nconsidering the general state of ignorance prevailing at this time, was\\nmost remarkable. Professor Meyer says: “He is to be regarded as the\\nintellectual originator of experimental research, if the departure in\\nthis direction is to be coupled with any one name--a direction which,\\nfollowed more and more as time went on, gave to the science [of\\nChemistry] its own peculiar stamp, and ensured its steady\\ndevelopment.”[46] Roger Bacon studied theology and science at Oxford and\\nat Paris; and he joined the Franciscan order, at what date, however, is\\nuncertain. He was particularly interested in optics, and certain\\ndiscoveries in this branch of physics have been attributed to him,\\nthough probably erroneously. It appears, also, that he was acquainted\\nwith gunpowder, which was, however, not employed in Europe until many\\nyears later.[47] Unfortunately, he earned the undesirable reputation of\\nbeing in communication with the powers of darkness, and as he did not\\nhesitate to oppose many of the opinions current at the time, he\\nsuffered much persecution. He was a firm believer in the powers of the\\nPhilosopher’s Stone to transmute large quantities of “base” metal into\\ngold, and also to extend the life of the individual. “_Alchimy_,” he\\nsays, “is a Science, teaching how to transforme any kind of mettall into\\nanother: and that by a proper medicine, as it appeareth by many\\nPhilosophers Bookes. _Alchimy_ therefore is a science teaching how to\\nmake and compound a certaine medicine, which is called _Elixir_, the\\nwhich when it is cast upon mettals or imperfect bodies, doth fully\\nperfect them in the verie projection.”[48] He also believed in\\nAstrology; but, nevertheless, he was entirely opposed to many of the\\nmagical and superstitious notions held at the time, and his tract, _De\\nSecretis Operibus Artis et Naturæ, et de Nullitate Magiæ_, was an\\nendeavour to prove that many so-called “miracles” could be brought about\\nsimply by the aid of natural science. Roger Bacon was a firm supporter\\nof the Sulphur-Mercury theory: he says: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. the natural principles in\\nthe mynes, are _Argent-vive_, and _Sulphur_. All mettals and minerals,\\nwhereof there be sundrie and divers kinds, are begotten of these two:\\nbut I must tel you, that nature alwaies intendeth and striveth to the\\nperfection of Gold: but many accidents coming between, change the\\nmetalls. .\\xa0.\\xa0. For according to the puritie and impuritie of the two\\naforesaide principles, _Argent-vive_ and _Sulphur_, pure, and impure\\nmettals are ingendred.”[49] He expresses surprise that any should employ\\nanimal and vegetable substances in their attempts to prepare the Stone,\\na practice common to some alchemists but warmly criticised by others.\\nHe says: “Nothing may be mingled with mettalls which hath not beene made\\nor sprung from them, it remaineth cleane inough, that no strange thing\\nwhich hath not his originall from these two [viz., sulphur and mercury],\\nis able to perfect them, or to make a chaunge and new transmutation of\\nthem: so that it is to be wondered at, that any wise man should set his\\nmind upon living creatures, or vegetables which are far off, when there\\nbe minerals to bee found nigh enough: neither may we in any wise thinke,\\nthat any of the Philosophers placed the Art in the said remote things,\\nexcept it were by way of comparison.”[50] The one process necessary for\\nthe preparation of the Stone, he tells us, is “continuall concoction” in\\nthe fire, which is the method that “God hath given to nature.”[51] He\\ndied about 1294.\\n\\n    [46] ERNST VON MEYER: _A History of Chemistry_ (translated by Dr.\\n    McGowan, 1906), p. 35.\\n\\n    [47] See ROGER BACON’S _Discovery of Miracles_, chaps. vi. and xi.\\n\\n    [48] ROGER BACON: _The Mirror of Alchimy_ (1597), p. 1.\\n\\n    [49] _Ibid._ p. 2.\\n\\n    [50] ROGER BACON: _The Mirror of Alchimy_ (1597), p. 4.\\n\\n    [51] _Ibid._ p. 9.\\n\\n\\nArnold de Villanova (12--?-1310?).\\n\\n§ =37.= The date and birthplace of =Arnold de Villanova=, or Villeneuve,\\nare both uncertain.

To\\navoid persecution at the hands of the Inquisition, he was obliged to\\nleave Spain, and ultimately found safety with Frederick II. in Sicily.\\nHe was famous not only as an alchemist, but also as a skilful physician.\\nHe died (it is thought in a shipwreck) about 1310-1313.\\n\\n\\nRaymond Lully (1235?-1315).\\n\\n§ =38.= =Raymond Lully=, the son of a noble Spanish family, was born at\\nPalma (in Majorca) about 1235. He was a man of somewhat eccentric\\ncharacter--in his youth a man of pleasure; in his maturity, a mystic\\nand ascetic. His career was of a roving and adventurous character. We\\nare told that, in his younger days, although married, he became\\nviolently infatuated with a lady of the name of Ambrosia de Castello,\\nwho vainly tried to dissuade him from his profane passion. Her efforts\\nproving futile, she requested Lully to call upon her, and in the\\npresence of her husband, bared to his sight her breast, which was almost\\neaten away by a cancer. This sight--so the story goes--brought about\\nLully’s conversion. He became actuated by the idea of converting to\\nChristianity the heathen in Africa, and engaged the services of an\\nArabian whereby he might learn the language. The man, however,\\ndiscovering his master’s object, attempted to assassinate him, and Lully\\nnarrowly escaped with his life. But his enthusiasm for missionary work\\nnever abated--his central idea was the reasonableness and\\ndemonstrability of Christian doctrine--and unhappily he was, at last,\\nstoned to death by the inhabitants of Bugiah (in Algeria) in 1315.[52]\\n\\n    [52] See _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_ (1815), pp. 17 _et\\n    seq._\\n\\nA very large number of alchemistic, theological and other treatises are\\nattributed to Lully, many of which are undoubtedly spurious; and it is a\\ndifficult question to decide exactly which are genuine. He is supposed\\nto have derived a knowledge of Alchemy from Roger Bacon and Arnold de\\nVillanova. It appears more probable, however, either that Lully the\\nalchemist was a personage distinct from the Lully whose life we have\\nsketched above, or that the alchemistic writings attributed to him are\\nforgeries of a similar nature to the works of pseudo-Geber (§ 32). Of\\nthese alchemical writings we may here mention the _Clavicula_. This he\\nsays is the key to all his other books on Alchemy, in which books the\\nwhole Art is fully declared, though so obscurely as not to be\\nunderstandable without its aid. In this work an alleged method for what\\nmay be called the multiplication of the “noble” metals rather than\\ntransmutation is described in clear language; but it should be noticed\\nthat the stone employed is itself a compound either of silver or gold.\\nAccording to Lully, the secret of the Philosopher’s Stone is the\\nextraction of the mercury of silver or gold. He writes: “Metals cannot\\nbe transmuted .\\xa0.\\xa0. in the Minerals, unless they be reduced into their\\nfirst Matter. .\\xa0.\\xa0. Therefore I counsel you, O my Friends, that you do\\nnot work but about _Sol_ and _Luna_, reducing them into the first\\nMatter, our _Sulphur_ and _Argent vive_: therefore, Son, you are to use\\nthis venerable Matter; and I swear unto you and promise, that unless you\\ntake the _Argent vive_ of these two, you go to the Practick as blind men\\nwithout eyes or sense. .\\xa0.\\xa0.”[53]\\n\\n    [53] RAYMOND LULLY: _Clavicula, or, A Little Key_ (see _Aurifontina\\n    Chymica_, 1680, p. 167).\\n\\n\\nPeter Bonus (14th Century).\\n\\n§ =39.= In 1546, a work was published entitled _Magarita Pretiosa_,\\nwhich claimed to be a “faithful abridgement,” by “Janus Lacinus\\nTherapus, the Calabrian,” of a MS. written by =Peter Bonus= in the\\nfourteenth century. An abridged English translation of this book by Mr.\\nA. E. Waite was published in 1894. Of the life of Bonus, who is said to\\nhave been an inhabitant of Pola, a seaport of Istria, nothing is known;\\nbut the _Magarita Pretiosa_ is an alchemistic work of considerable\\ninterest. The author commences, like pseudo-Geber in his _Sum of\\nPerfection_, by bringing forward a number of very ingenious arguments\\nagainst the validity of the Art; he then proceeds with arguments in\\nfavour of Alchemy and puts forward answers in full to the former\\nobjections; further difficulties, &c., are then dealt with. In all this,\\ncompared with many other alchemists, Bonus, though somewhat prolix, is\\nremarkably lucid. All metals, he argues, following the views of\\npseudo-Geber, consist of mercury and sulphur; but whilst the mercury is\\nalways one and the same, different metals contain different sulphurs.\\nThere are also two different kinds of sulphurs--inward and outward.\\nSulphur is necessary for the development of the mercury, but for the\\nfinal product, gold, to come forth, it is necessary that the outward and\\nimpure sulphur be purged off. “Each metal,” says Bonus, “differs from\\nall the rest, and has a certain perfection and completeness of its own;\\nbut none, except gold, has reached that highest degree of perfection of\\nwhich it is capable. For all common metals there is a transient and a\\nperfect state of inward completeness, and this perfect state they attain\\neither through the slow operation of Nature, or through the sudden\\ntransformatory power of our Stone. We must, however, add that the\\nimperfect metals form part of the great plan and design of Nature,\\nthough they are in course of transformation into gold. For a large\\nnumber of very useful and indispensable tools and utensils could not be\\nprovided at all if there were no copper, iron, tin, or lead, and if all\\nmetals were either silver or gold. For this beneficent reason Nature\\nhas furnished us with the metallic substance in all its different stages\\nof development, from iron, or the lowest, to gold, or the highest state\\nof metallic perfection. Nature is ever studying variety, and, for that\\nreason, instead of covering the whole face of the earth with water, has\\nevolved out of that elementary substance a great diversity of forms,\\nembracing the whole animal, vegetable and mineral world. It is, in like\\nmanner, for the use of men that Nature has differentiated the metallic\\nsubstance into a great variety of species and forms.”[54] According to\\nthis interesting alchemistic work, the Art of Alchemy consists, not in\\nreducing the imperfect metals to their first substance, but in carrying\\nforward Nature’s work, developing the imperfect metals to perfection and\\nremoving their impure sulphur.\\n\\n    [54] PETER BONUS: _The New Pearl of Great Price_ (Mr. A. E. Waite’s\\n    translation, pp. 176-177).\\n\\n\\nNicolas Flamel (1330-1418).\\n\\n§ =40.= Nicolas Flamel (see plate 8) was born about 1330, probably in\\nParis. His parents were poor, and Nicolas took up the trade of a\\nscrivener. In the course of time, Flamel became a very wealthy man and,\\nat the same time, it appears, one who exhibited considerable\\nmunificence. This increase in Flamel’s wealth has been attributed to\\nsupposed success in the Hermetic Art. We are told that a remarkable book\\ncame into the young scrivener’s possession, which, at first, he was\\nunable to understand, until, at last, he had the good fortune to meet an\\nadept who translated its mysteries for him. This book revealed the\\noccult secrets of Alchemy, and by its means Nicolas was enabled to\\nobtain immense quantities of gold. This story, however, appears to be of\\na legendary nature, and it seems more likely that Flamel’s riches\\nresulted from his business as a scrivener and from moneylending. At any\\nrate, all of the alchemistic works attributed to Flamel are of more or\\nless questionable origin. One of these, entitled _A Short Tract, or\\nPhilosophical Summary_, will be found in _The Hermetic Museum_. It is a\\nvery brief work, supporting the sulphur-mercury theory.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 8.\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF THOMAS AQUINAS.\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF NICOLAS FLAMEL.\\n\\n_To face page 52_]]\\n\\n\\n“Basil Valentine” and “The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony.”\\n\\n§ =41.= Probably the most celebrated of all alchemistic books is the\\nwork known as _Triumph-Wagen des Antimonii_. A Latin translation with a\\ncommentary by Theodore Kerckringius was published in 1685, and an\\nEnglish translation of this version by Mr. A. E. Waite appeared in 1893.\\nThe author describes himself as “=Basil Valentine=, a Benedictine monk.”\\nIn his “_Practica_,” another alchemistic work, he says: “When I had\\nemptied to the dregs the cup of human suffering, I was led to consider\\nthe wretchedness of this world, and the fearful consequences of our\\nfirst parents’ disobedience .\\xa0.\\xa0. I made haste to withdraw myself from\\nthe evil world, to bid farewell to it, and to devote myself to the\\nService of God.”[55] He proceeds to relate that he entered a monastery,\\nbut finding that he had some time on his hands after performing his\\ndaily work and devotions, and not wishing to pass this time in idleness,\\nhe took up the study of Alchemy, “the investigation of those natural\\nsecrets by which God has shadowed out eternal things,” and at last\\nhis labours were rewarded by the discovery of a Stone most potent in the\\ncuring of diseases. In _The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony_ are\\naccurately described a large number of antimonial preparations, and as\\nBasil was supposed to have written this work some time in the fifteenth\\ncentury, these preparations were accordingly concluded to have been, for\\nthe most part, his own discoveries. He defends with the utmost vigour\\nthe medicinal values of antimony, and criticises in terms far from mild\\nthe physicians of his day. On account of this work Basil Valentine has\\nranked very high as an experimental chemist; but from quite early times\\nits date and authorship have been regarded alike as doubtful; and it\\nappears from the researches of the late Professor Schorlemmer “to be an\\nundoubted forgery dating from about 1600, the information being culled\\nfrom the works of other writers. .\\xa0.\\xa0.”[56] Probably the other works\\nascribed to Basil Valentine are of a like nature. _The Triumphal Chariot\\nof Antimony_ does, however, give an accurate account of the knowledge of\\nantimony of this time, and the pseudo-Valentine shows himself to have\\nbeen a man of considerable experience with regard to this subject.\\n\\n    [55] “BASIL VALENTINE”: _The “Practica”_ (see _The Hermetic Museum_,\\n    vol. i. p. 313).\\n\\n    [56] Sir H.

They are supposed\\nto have lived during the fifteenth century, but of their lives nothing\\nis known. Isaac, although not free from superstitious opinions, appears\\nto have been a practical chemist, and his works, which abound in\\nrecipes, were held in great esteem by Paracelsus and other alchemists.\\nHe held that all things in this world are of a dual nature, partly good\\nand partly bad. “.\\xa0.\\xa0. All that God hath created good in the upper part\\nof the world,” he writes, “are perfect and uncorruptible, as the heaven:\\nbut whatsoever in these lower parts, whether it be in beasts, fishes,\\nand all manner of sensible creatures, hearbs or plants, it is indued\\nwith a double nature, that is to say, perfect, and unperfect; the\\nperfect nature is called the Quintessence, the unperfect the Feces or\\ndreggs, or the venemous or combustible oile. .\\xa0.\\xa0. God hath put a secret\\nnature or influence in every creature, and .\\xa0.\\xa0. to every nature of one\\nsort or kind he hath given one common influence and vertue, whether it\\nbee on Physick or other secret works, which partly are found out by\\nnaturall workmanship. And yet more things are unknown than are apparent\\nto our senses.”[57] He gives directions for extracting the Quintessence,\\nfor which marvellous powers are claimed, out of sugar and other organic\\nsubstances; and he appears to be the earliest known writer who makes\\nmention of the famous sulphur-mercury-salt theory.\\n\\n    [57] _One hundred and Fourteen Experiments and Cures of the Famous\\n    Physitian Theophrastus Paracelsus, whereunto is added .\\xa0.\\xa0. certain\\n    Secrets of Isaac Hollandus, concerning the Vegetall and Animall\\n    Work_ (1652), p. 35.\\n\\n\\nBernard Trévisan (1406-1490).\\n\\n§ =43.= =Bernard Trévisan=, a French count of the fifteenth century,\\nsquandered enormous sums of money in the search for the Stone, in which\\nthe whole of his life and energies were engaged. He seems to have become\\nthe dupe of one charlatan after another, but at last, at a ripe old\\nage, he says that his labours were rewarded, and that he successfully\\nperformed the _magnum opus_. In a short, but rather obscure work, he\\nspeaks of the Philosopher’s Stone in the following words: “This Stone\\nthen is compounded of a Body and Spirit, or of a volatile and fixed\\nSubstance, and that is therefore done, because nothing in the World can\\nbe generated and brought to light without these two Substances, to wit,\\na Male and Female: From whence it appeareth, that although these two\\nSubstances are not of one and the same species, yet one Stone doth\\nthence arise, and although they appear and are said to be two\\nSubstances, yet in truth it is but one, to wit, _Argent-vive_.”[58] He\\nappears, however, to have added nothing to our knowledge of chemical\\nscience.\\n\\n    [58] BERNARD, EARL OF TRÉVISAN: _A Treatise of the Philosophers\\n    Stone_, 1683 (see _Collectanea Chymica: A Collection of Ten Several\\n    Treatises in Chemistry_, 1684, p. 91).\\n\\n\\nSir George Ripley (14--?-1490?).\\n\\n§ =44.= =Sir George Ripley=, an eminent alchemistic philosopher of the\\nfifteenth century, entered upon a monastic life when a youth, becoming\\none of the canons regular of Bridlington. After some travels he returned\\nto England and obtaining leave from the Pope to live in solitude, he\\ndevoted himself to the study of the Hermetic Art. His chief work is _The\\nCompound of Alchymie .\\xa0.\\xa0. conteining twelve Gates_, which was written\\nin 1471. In this curious work, we learn that there are twelve processes\\nnecessary for the achievement of the _magnum opus_, namely, Calcination,\\nSolution, Separation, Conjunction, Putrefaction, Congelation, Cibation,\\nSublimation, Fermentation, Exaltation, Multiplication, and Projection.\\nThese are likened to the twelve gates of a castle which the philosopher\\nmust enter. At the conclusion of the twelfth gate, Ripley says:--\\n\\n      “Now thou hast conqueryd the _twelve Gates_,\\n    And all the Castell thou holdyst at wyll,\\n    Keep thy Secretts in store unto thy selve;\\n    And the commaundements of God looke thou fulfull:\\n    In fyer conteinue thy glas styll,\\n      And Multeply thy Medcyns ay more and more,\\n      For wyse men done say _store ys no sore_.”[59]\\n\\n    [59] Sir GEORGE RIPLEY: _The Compound of Alchemy_ (see _Theatrum\\n    Chemicum Britannicum_, edited by Elias Ashmole, 1652, p. 186).\\n\\nAt the conclusion of the work he tells us that in all that he wrote\\nbefore he was mistaken; he says:--\\n\\n      “I made _Solucyons_ full many a one,\\n    Of Spyrytts, Ferments, Salts, Yerne and Steele;\\n    Wenyng so to make the Phylosophers Stone:\\n    But fynally I lost eche dele,\\n    After my Boks yet wrought I well;\\n      Whych evermore untrue I provyd,\\n      That made me oft full sore agrevyd.”[60]\\n\\n    [60] _Ibid._ p. 189.\\n\\nRipley did much to popularise the works of Raymond Lully in England, but\\ndoes not appear to have added to the knowledge of practical chemistry.\\nHis _Bosom Book_, which contains an alleged method for preparing the\\nStone, will be found in the _Collectanea Chemica_ (1893).\\n\\n\\nThomas Norton (15th Century).\\n\\n§ =45.= =Thomas Norton=, the author of the celebrated _Ordinall of\\nAlchemy_, was probably born shortly before the commencement of the\\nfifteenth century. The _Ordinall_, which is written in verse (and which\\nwill be found in Ashmole’s _Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum_),[61] is\\nanonymous, but the author’s identity is revealed by a curious device.\\nThe initial syllables of the proem and of the first six chapters,\\ntogether with the first line of the seventh chapter, give the following\\ncouplet:--\\n\\n    “Tomais Norton of Briseto,\\n    A parfet _Master_ ye maie him call trowe.”\\n\\n    [61] A prose version will be found in _The Hermetic Museum_\\n    translated back into English from a Latin translation by Maier.\\n\\nSamuel Norton, the grandson of Thomas, who was also an alchemist, says\\nthat Thomas Norton was a member of the privy chamber of Edward IV.\\nNorton’s distinctive views regarding the generation of the metals we\\nhave already mentioned (see § 20). He taught that true knowledge of the\\nArt of Alchemy could only be obtained by word of mouth from an adept,\\nand in his _Ordinall_ he gives an account of his own initiation. He\\ntells us that he was instructed by his master (probably Sir George\\nRipley) and learnt the secrets of the Art in forty days, at the age of\\ntwenty-eight. He does not, however, appear to have reaped the fruits of\\nthis knowledge. Twice, he tells us, did he prepare the Elixir, and twice\\nwas it stolen from him; and he is said to have died in 1477, after\\nruining himself and his friends by his unsuccessful experiments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nTHE ALCHEMISTS (_continued_)\\n\\n(B. PARACELSUS AND AFTER)\\n\\n\\nParacelsus (1493-1541.)\\n\\n§ =46.= That erratic genius, =Paracelsus=--or, to give him his correct\\nname, Philip (?) Aureole (?) =Theophrast Bombast von Hohenheim=--whose\\nportrait forms the frontispiece to the present work--was born at\\nEinsiedeln in Switzerland in 1493. He studied the alchemistic and\\nmedical arts under his father, who was a physician, and continued his\\nstudies later at the University of Basle. He also gave some time to the\\nstudy of magic and the occult sciences under the famous Trithemius of\\nSpanheim. Paracelsus, however, found the merely theoretical “book\\nlearning” of the university curriculum unsatisfactory and betook himself\\nto the mines, where he might study the nature of metals at first hand.\\nHe then spent several years in travelling, visiting some of the chief\\ncountries of Europe. At last he returned to Basle, the chair of Medical\\nScience of his old university being bestowed upon him. The works of\\nIsaac of Holland had inspired him with the desire to improve upon the\\nmedical science of his day, and in his lectures (which were, contrary\\nto the usual custom, delivered not in Latin, but in the German language)\\nhe denounced in violent terms the teachings of Galen and Avicenna, who\\nwere until then the accredited authorities on medical matters. His use\\nof the German tongue, his coarseness in criticism and his intense\\nself-esteem, combined with the fact that he did lay bare many of the\\nmedical follies and frauds of his day, brought him into very general\\ndislike with the rest of the physicians, and the municipal authorities\\nsiding with the aggrieved apothecaries and physicians, whose methods\\nParacelsus had exposed, he fled from Basle and resumed his former roving\\nlife. He was, so we are told, a man of very intemperate habits, being\\nseldom sober (a statement seriously open to doubt); but on the other\\nhand, he certainly accomplished a very large number of most remarkable\\ncures, and, judging from his writings, he was inspired by lofty and\\nnoble ideals and a fervent belief in the Christian religion. He died in\\n1541.\\n\\nParacelsus combined in himself such opposite characteristics that it is\\na matter of difficulty to criticise him aright. As says Professor\\nFerguson: “It is most difficult .\\xa0.\\xa0. to ascertain what his true\\ncharacter really was, to appreciate aright this man of fervid\\nimagination, of powerful and persistent conviction, of unbated honesty\\nand love of truth, of keen insight into the errors (as he thought them)\\nof his time, of a merciless will to lay bare these errors and to reform\\nthe abuses to which they gave rise, who in an instant offends by his\\nboasting, his grossness, his want of self-respect. It is a problem how\\nto reconcile his ignorance, his weakness, his superstition, his crude\\nnotions, his erroneous observations, his ridiculous inferences and\\ntheories, with his grasp of method, his lofty views of the true scope of\\nmedicine, his lucid statements, his incisive and epigrammatic criticisms\\nof men and motives.”[62] It is also a problem of considerable difficulty\\nto determine which of the many books attributed to him are really his\\ngenuine works, and consequently what his views on certain points exactly\\nwere.\\n\\n    [62] JOHN FERGUSON, M.A.: Article “Paracelsus,” _Encyclopædia\\n    Britannica_, 9th edition (1885), vol. xviii. p. 236.\\n\\n\\nViews of Paracelsus.\\n\\n§ =47.= Paracelsus was the first to recognise the desirability of\\ninvestigating the physical universe with a motive other than\\nalchemistic. He taught that “the object of chemistry is not to make\\ngold, but to prepare medicines,” and founded the school of\\nIatro-chemistry or Medical Chemistry. This synthesis of chemistry with\\nmedicine was of very great benefit to each science; new possibilities of\\nchemical investigation were opened up now that the aim was not purely\\nalchemistic. Paracelsus’s central theory was that of the analogy between\\nman, the microcosm, and the world or macrocosm. He regarded all the\\nactions that go on in the human body as of a chemical nature, and he\\nthought that illness was the result of a disproportion in the body\\nbetween the quantities of the three great principles--sulphur, mercury,\\nand salt--which he regarded as constituting all things; for example, he\\nconsidered an excess of sulphur as the cause of fever, since sulphur was\\nthe fiery principle, &c. The basis of the iatro-chemical doctrines,\\nnamely, that the healthy human body is a particular combination of\\nchemical substances: illness the result of some change in this\\ncombination, and hence curable only by chemical medicines, expresses a\\ncertain truth, and is undoubtedly a great improvement upon the ideas of\\nthe ancients. But in the elaboration of his medical doctrines Paracelsus\\nfell a prey to exaggeration and the fantastic, and many of his theories\\nappear to be highly ridiculous. This extravagance is also very\\npronounced in the alchemistic works attributed to him; for example, the\\nbelief in the artificial creation of minute living creatures resembling\\nmen (called “homunculi”)--a belief of the utmost absurdity, if we are to\\nunderstand it literally. On the other hand, his writings do contain much\\ntrue teaching of a mystical nature; his doctrine of the correspondence\\nof man with the universe considered as a whole, for example, certainly\\nbeing radically true, though fantastically stated and developed by\\nParacelsus himself.\\n\\n\\nIatro-Chemistry.\\n\\n§ =48.= Between the pupils of Paracelsus and the older school of\\nmedicine, as might well be supposed, a battle royal was waged for a\\nconsiderable time, which ultimately concluded, if not with a full\\nvindication of Paracelsus’s teaching, yet with the acceptance of the\\nfundamental iatro-chemical doctrines. Henceforward it is necessary to\\ndistinguish between the chemists and the alchemists--to distinguish\\nthose who pursued chemical studies with the object of discovering and\\npreparing useful medicines, and later those who pursued such studies for\\ntheir own sake, from those whose object was the transmutation of the\\n“base” metals into gold, whether from purely selfish motives, or with\\nthe desire to demonstrate on the physical plane the validity of the\\ndoctrines of Mysticism. However, during the following century or two we\\nfind, very often, the chemist and the alchemist united in one and the\\nsame person. Men such as Glauber and Boyle, whose names will ever be\\nremembered by chemists, did not doubt the possibility of performing the\\n_magnum opus_. In the present chapter, however, we shall confine our\\nattention for the most part to those men who may be regarded, for one\\nreason or another, particularly as _alchemists_. And the alchemists of\\nthe period we are now considering present a very great diversity. On the\\none hand, we have men of much chemical knowledge and skill such as\\nLibavius and van Helmont, on the other hand we have those who stand\\nequally as high as exponents of mystic wisdom--men such as Jacob Boehme\\nand, to a less extent, Thomas Vaughan. We have those, who, although they\\ndid not enrich the science of Chemistry with any new discoveries, were,\\nnevertheless, regarded as masters of the Hermetic Art; and, finally, we\\nhave alchemists of the Edward Kelley and “Cagliostro” type, whose main\\nobject was their own enrichment at their neighbours’ expense. Before,\\nhowever, proceeding to an account of the lives and teachings of these\\nmen, there is one curious matter--perhaps the most remarkable of all\\nhistorical curiosities--that calls for some brief consideration. We\\nrefer to the “far-famed” Rosicrucian Society.\\n\\n\\nThe Rosicrucian Society.\\n\\n§ =49.= The exoteric history of the Rosicrucian Society commences with\\nthe year 1614. In that year there was published at Cassel in Germany a\\npamphlet entitled _The Discovery of the Fraternity of the Meritorious\\nOrder of the Rosy Cross, addressed to the Learned in General and the\\nGovernors of Europe_. After a discussion of the momentous question of\\nthe general reformation of the world, which was to be accomplished\\nthrough the medium of a secret confederacy of the wisest and most\\nphilanthropic men, the pamphlet proceeds to inform its readers that such\\nan association is in existence, founded over one hundred years ago by\\nthe famous C.R.C., grand initiate in the mysteries of Alchemy, whose\\nhistory (which is clearly of a fabulous or symbolical nature) is given.\\nThe book concludes by inviting the wise men of the time to join the\\nFraternity, directing those who wished to do so to indicate their desire\\nby the publication of printed letters, which should come into the hands\\nof the Brotherhood. As might well be expected, the pamphlet was the\\ncause of considerable interest and excitement, but although many letters\\nwere printed, apparently none of them were vouchsafed a reply. The\\nfollowing year a further pamphlet appeared, _The Confession of the\\nRosicrucian Fraternity, addressed to the Learned in Europe_, and in\\n1616, _The Chymical Nuptials of Christian Rosencreutz_. This latter book\\nis a remarkable allegorical romance, describing how an old man, a\\nlifelong student of the alchemistic Art, was present at the\\naccomplishment of the _magnum opus_ in the year 1459. An enormous amount\\nof controversy took place; it was plain to some that the Society had\\ndeluded them, whilst others hotly maintained its claims; but after about\\nfour years had passed, the excitement had subsided, and the subject\\nceased, for the time being, to arouse any particular interest.\\n\\nSome writers, even in recent times, more gifted for romance than for\\nhistorical research, have seen in the Rosicrucian Society a secret\\nconfederacy of immense antiquity and of stupendous powers, consisting of\\nthe great initiates of all ages, supposed to be in possession of the\\narch secrets of alchemistic art. It is abundantly evident, however, that\\nit was nothing of the sort. It is clear from an examination of the\\npamphlets already mentioned that they are animated by Lutheran ideals;\\nand it is of interest to note that Luther’s seal contained both the\\ncross and the rose--whence the term “Rosicrucian.” The generally\\naccepted theory regards the pamphlets as a sort of elaborate hoax\\nperpetrated by Valentine Andreä, a young and benevolent Lutheran divine;\\nbut more, however, than a mere hoax. As the late Mr. R. A. Vaughan\\nwrote: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. this Andreä writes the _Discovery of the Rosicrucian\\nBrotherhood, a jeu-d’esprit_ with a serious purpose, just as an\\nexperiment to see whether something cannot be done by combined effort to\\nremedy the defect and abuses--social, educational, and religious, so\\nlamented by all good men. He thought there were many Andreäs scattered\\nthroughout Europe--how powerful would be their united systematic action!\\n.\\xa0.\\xa0. He hoped that the few nobler minds whom he desired to organize\\nwould see through the veil of fiction in which he had invested his\\nproposal; that he might communicate personally with some such, if they\\nshould appear; or that his book might lead them to form among themselves\\na practical philanthropic confederacy, answering to the serious purpose\\nhe had embodied in his fiction.”[63] His scheme was a failure, and on\\nseeing its result, Andreä, not daring to reveal himself as the author of\\nthe pamphlets, did his best to put a stop to the folly by writing\\nseveral works in criticism of the Society and its claims. Mr. A. E.\\nWaite, however, whose work on the subject should be consulted for\\nfurther information, rejects this theory, and suggests that the\\nRosicrucian Society was probably identical with the _Militia Crucifera\\nEvangelica_, a secret society founded in Nuremburg by the Lutheran\\nalchemist and mystic, Simon Studion.[64]\\n\\n    [63] ROBERT ALFRED VAUGHAN, B.A.: _Hours with the Mystics_ (7th\\n    edition, 1895), vol. ii. bk. 8, chap. ix. p. 134.\\n\\n    [64] ARTHUR EDWARD WAITE: _The Real History of the Rosicrucians_,\\n    (1887).\\n\\n\\nThomas Charnock (1524-1581).\\n\\n§ =50.= We must now turn our attention to the lives and teachings of the\\nalchemists of the period under consideration, treating them, as far as\\npossible, in chronological order; whence the first alchemist to come\\nunder our notice is Thomas Charnock.\\n\\n=Thomas Charnock= was born at Faversham (Kent), either in the year 1524\\nor in 1526. After some travels over England he settled at Oxford,\\ncarrying on experiments in Alchemy. In 1557 he wrote his _Breviary of\\nPhilosophy_. This work is almost entirely autobiographical, describing\\nCharnock’s alchemistic experiences. He tells us that he was initiated\\ninto the mysteries of the Hermetic Art by a certain James S. of\\nSalisbury; he also had another master, an old blind man, who on his\\ndeath-bed instructed Charnock. Unfortunately, however, Thomas was doomed\\nto failure in his experiments. On the first attempt his apparatus caught\\nfire and his work was destroyed. His next experiments were ruined by the\\nnegligence of a servant. His final misfortune shall be described in his\\nown words. He had started the work for a third time, and had spent much\\nmoney on his fire, hoping to be shortly rewarded. .\\xa0.\\xa0.\\n\\n    “Then a _Gentleman_ that oughte me great mallice\\n    Caused me to be prest to goe serve at _Callys_:\\n    When I saw there was no other boote,\\n    But that I must goe spight of my heart roote;\\n    In my fury I tooke a Hatchet in my hand,\\n    And brake all my Worke whereas it did stand.”[65]\\n\\n    [65] THOMAS CHARNOCK: _The Breviary of Naturall Philosophy_ (see\\n    _Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum_, edited by Ashmole, 1652, p. 295.)\\n\\nThomas Charnock married in 1562 a Miss Agnes Norden. He died in 1581. It\\nis, perhaps, unnecessary to say that his name does not appear in the\\nhistory of Chemistry.\\n\\n\\nAndreas Libavius (1540-1616.)\\n\\n§ =51.= =Andreas Libavius= was born at Halle in Germany in 1540, where\\nhe studied medicine and practiced for a short time as a physician. He\\naccepted the fundamental iatro-chemical doctrines, at the same time,\\nhowever, criticising certain of the more extravagant views expressed by\\nParacelsus. He was a firm believer in the transmutation of the metals,\\nbut his own activities were chiefly directed to the preparation of new\\nand better medicines. He enriched the science of Chemistry by many\\nvaluable discoveries, and tin tetra-chloride, which he was the first to\\nprepare, is still known by the name of _spiritus fumans Libavii_.\\nLibavius was a man possessed of keen powers of observation; and his work\\non Chemistry, which contains a full account of the knowledge of the\\nscience of his time, may be regarded as the first text-book of\\nChemistry. It was held in high esteem for a considerable time, being\\nreprinted on several occasions.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 9.\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF EDWARD KELLEY.\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF JOHN DEE.\\n\\n_To face page 68_]]\\n\\n\\nEdward Kelley (1555-1595) and John Dee (1527-1608.)\\n\\n§ =52.= Edward Kelley or Kelly (see plate 9) was born at Worcester on\\nAugust 1, 1555. His life is so obscured by various traditions that it is\\nvery difficult to arrive at the truth concerning it. The latest, and\\nprobably the best, account will be found in Miss Charlotte Fell Smith’s\\n_John Dee_ (1909). Edward Kelley, according to some accounts, was\\nbrought up as an apothecary.[66] He is also said to have entered Oxford\\nUniversity under the pseudonym of Talbot.[67] Later, he practised as a\\nnotary in London. He is said to have committed a forgery, for which he\\nhad his ears cropped; but another account, which supposes him to have\\navoided this penalty by making his escape to Wales, is not improbable.\\nOther crimes of which he is accused are coining and necromancy. He was\\nprobably not guilty of all these crimes, but that he was undoubtedly a\\ncharlatan and profligate the sequel will make plain. We are told that\\nabout the time of his alleged escape to Wales, whilst in the\\nneighbourhood of Glastonbury Abbey, he became possessed, by a lucky\\nchance, of a manuscript by St. Dunstan setting forth the grand secrets\\nof Alchemy, together with some of the two transmuting tinctures, both\\nwhite and red,[68] which had been discovered in a tomb near by. His\\nfriendship with John Dee, or Dr. Dee as he is generally called,\\ncommenced in 1582. Now, =John Dee= (see plate 9) was undoubtedly a\\nmathematician of considerable erudition. He was also an astrologer, and\\nwas much interested in experiments in “crystal-gazing,” for which\\npurpose he employed a speculum of polished cannel-coal, and by means of\\nwhich he believed that he had communication with the inhabitants of\\nspiritual spheres. It appears that Kelley, who probably did possess some\\nmediumistic powers, the results of which he augmented by means of fraud,\\ninterested himself in these experiments, and not only became the\\ndoctor’s “scryer,” but also gulled him into the belief that he was in\\nthe possession of the arch-secrets of Alchemy. In 1583, Kelley and his\\nlearned dupe left England together with their wives and a Polish\\nnobleman, staying firstly at Cracovia and afterwards at Prague, where it\\nis not unlikely that the Emperor Rudolph II. knighted Kelley. As\\ninstances of the belief which the doctor had in Kelley’s powers as an\\nalchemist, we may note that in his Private Diary under the date December\\n19, 1586, Dee records that Kelley performed a transmutation for the\\nbenefit of one Edward Garland and his brother Francis;[69] and under\\nthe date May 10, 1588, we find the following recorded: “E.K. did open\\nthe great secret to me, God be thanked!”[70] That he was not always\\nwithout doubts as to Kelley’s honesty, however, is evident from other\\nentries in his Diary. In 1587 occurred an event which must be recorded\\nto the partners’ lasting shame. To cap his former impositions, Kelley\\ninformed the doctor that by the orders of a spirit which had appeared to\\nhim in the crystal, they were to share “their two wives in common”; to\\nwhich arrangement, after some further persuasion, Dee consented.\\nKelley’s profligacy and violent temper, however, had already been the\\ncause of some disagreement between him and the doctor, and this incident\\nleading to a further quarrel, the erstwhile friends parted. In 1589, the\\nEmperor Rudolph imprisoned Kelley, the price of his freedom being the\\ntransmutative secret, or a substantial quantity of gold, at least,\\nprepared by its aid. He was, however, released in 1593; but died in\\n1595; according to one account, as the result of an accident incurred\\nwhile attempting to escape from a second imprisonment. Dee merely\\nrecords that he received news to the effect that Kelley “was slayne.”\\n\\n    [66] See, for example, WILLIAM LILLY: _History of His Life and\\n    Times_ (1715, reprinted in 1822, p. 227).\\n\\n    [67] See ANTHONY À WOOD’S account of Kelley’s life in _Athenæ\\n    Oxonienses_ (3rd edition, edited by Philip Bliss, vol. i. col. 639.)\\n\\n    [68] William Lilly, the astrologer, in his _History of His Life and\\n    Times_ (1822 reprint, pp. 225-226), relates a different story\\n    regarding the manner in which Kelley is supposed to have obtained\\n    the Great Medicine, but as it is told at third hand, it is of little\\n    importance. We do not suppose that there can be much doubt that the\\n    truth was that Dee and others were deceived by some skilful\\n    conjuring tricks, for whatever else Kelley may have been, he\\n    certainly was a very ingenious fellow.\\n\\n    [69] _The Private Diary of Dr. John Dee_ (The Camden Society, 1842),\\n    p. 22.\\n\\n    [70] _The Private Diary of Dr. John Dee_ (The Camden Society, 1842),\\n    p. 27.\\n\\nIt was during his incarceration that he wrote an alchemistic work\\nentitled _The Stone of the Philosophers_, which consists largely of\\nquotations from older alchemistic writings. His other works on Alchemy\\nwere probably written at an earlier period.[71]\\n\\n    [71] An English translation of Kelley’s alchemistic works were\\n    published under the editorship of Mr. A. E. Waite, in 1893.\\n\\n\\nHenry Khunrath (1560-1605).\\n\\n§ =53.= =Henry Khunrath= was born in Saxony in the second half of the\\nsixteenth century. He was a follower of Paracelsus, and travelled about\\nGermany, practising as a physician. “This German alchemist,” says Mr. A.\\nE. Waite, “.\\xa0.\\xa0. is claimed as a hierophant of the psychic side of the\\n_magnum opus_, and .\\xa0.\\xa0. was undoubtedly aware of the larger issues, of\\nHermetic theorems”; he describes Khunrath’s chief work, _Amphitheatrum\\nSapientiæ Æternæ_, &c., as “purely mystical and magical.”[72]\\n\\n    [72] A. E. WAITE: _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_ (1888), p.\\n    159.\\n\\n\\nAlexander Sethon (?-1604) and Michael Sendivogius (1566?-1646).\\n\\n§ =54.= The date and birthplace of =Alexander Sethon=, a Scottish\\nalchemist, do not appear to have been recorded, but =Michael\\nSendivogius= was probably born in Moravia about 1566. Sethon, we are\\ntold, was in possession of the arch-secrets of Alchemy. He visited\\nHolland in 1602, proceeded after a time to Italy, and passed through\\nBasle to Germany; meanwhile he is said to have performed many\\ntransmutations. Ultimately arriving at Dresden, however, he fell into\\nthe clutches of the young Elector, Christian II., who, in order to\\nextort his secret, cast him into prison, and put him to the torture, but\\nwithout avail. Now, it so happened that Sendivogius, who was in quest of\\nthe Philosopher’s Stone, was staying at Dresden, and hearing of Sethon’s\\nimprisonment obtained permission to visit him. Sendivogius offered to\\neffect Sethon’s escape in return for assistance in his alchemistic\\npursuits, to which arrangement the Scottish alchemist willingly agreed.\\nAfter some considerable outlay of money in bribery, Sendivogius’s plan\\nof escape was successfully carried out, and Sethon found himself a free\\nman; but he refused to betray the high secrets of Hermetic philosophy to\\nhis rescuer. However, before his death, which occurred shortly\\nafterwards, he presented him with an ounce of the transmutative powder.\\nSendivogius soon used up this powder, we are told, in effecting\\ntransmutations and cures, and, being fond of expensive living, he\\nmarried Sethon’s widow, in the hope that she was in the possession of\\nthe transmutative secret. In this, however, he was disappointed; she\\nknew nothing of the matter, but she had the manuscript of an alchemistic\\nwork written by her late husband. Shortly afterwards Sendivogius printed\\nat Prague a book entitled _The New Chemical Light_ under the name of\\n“Cosmopolita,” which is said to be this work of Sethon’s but which\\nSendivogius claimed for his own by the insertion of his name on the\\ntitle-page, in the form of an anagram. The tract _On Sulphur_ which was\\nprinted at the end of later editions, however, is said to have been the\\ngenuine work of the Moravian. Whilst his powder lasted, Sendivogius\\ntravelled about, performing, we are told, many transmutations. He was\\ntwice imprisoned in order to extort the secrets of Alchemy from him, on\\none occasion escaping, and on the other occasion obtaining his release\\nfrom the Emperor Rudolph. Afterwards, he appears to have degenerated\\ninto an impostor, but this is said to have been a _finesse_ to hide his\\ntrue character as an alchemistic adept. He died in 1646.[73]\\n\\n    [73] See F. B.: _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_ (1815), pp.\\n    66-69.\\n\\nThe _New Chemical Light_ was held in great esteem by the alchemists. The\\nfirst part treats at length of the generation of the metals and also of\\nthe Philosopher’s Stone, and claims to be based on practical experience.\\nThe seed of Nature, we are told, is one, but various products result on\\naccount of the different conditions of development. An imaginary\\nconversation between Mercury, an Alchemist and Nature which is appended,\\nis not without a touch of humour. Says the Alchemist, in despair, “Now I\\nsee that I know nothing; only I must not say so. For I should lose the\\ngood opinion of my neighbours, and they would no longer entrust me with\\nmoney for my experiments. I must therefore go on saying that I know\\neverything; for there are many that expect me to do great things for\\nthem. .\\xa0.\\xa0. There are many countries, and many greedy persons who will\\nsuffer themselves to be gulled by my promises of mountains of gold. Thus\\nday will follow day, and in the meantime the King or the donkey will\\ndie, or I myself.”[74] The second part treats of the Elements and\\nPrinciples (see §§ 17 and 19).\\n\\n    [74] _The New Chemical Light_, Part I.

Brunn]\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF MICHAEL MAIER.\\n\\n_To face page 72_]]\\n\\n\\nMichael Maier (1568-1622).\\n\\n§ =55.= =Michael Maier= (see plate 10) was born at Rendsberg (in\\nHolstein) about 1568. He studied medicine assiduously, becoming a most\\nsuccessful physician, and he was ennobled by Rudolf II. Later on,\\nhowever, he took up the subject of Alchemy, and is said to have ruined\\nhis health and wasted his fortune in the pursuit of the alchemistic\\n_ignis fatuus_--the Stone of the Philosophers--travelling about Germany\\nand elsewhere in order to have converse with those who were regarded as\\nadepts in the Art. He took a prominent part in the famous Rosicrucian\\ncontroversy (see § 49), defending the claims of the alleged society in\\nseveral tracts. He is said, on the one hand, to have been admitted as a\\nmember of the fraternity; and on the other hand, to have himself founded\\na similar institution. A full account of his views will be found in the\\nRev. J. B. Craven’s _Count Michael Maier: Life and Writings_ (1910). He\\nwas a very learned man, but his works are somewhat obscure and abound in\\nfanciful allegories. He read an alchemistic meaning into the ancient\\nfables concerning the Egyptian and Greek gods and heroes. Like most\\nalchemists, he held the supposed virtues of mercury in high esteem. In\\nhis _Lusus Serius: or, Serious Passe-time_, for example, he supposes a\\nParliament of the various creatures of the world to meet, in order that\\nMan might choose the noblest of them as king over all the rest. The\\ncalf, the sheep, the goose, the oyster, the bee, the silkworm, flax and\\nmercury are the chosen representatives, each of which discourses in\\nturn. It will be unnecessary to state that Mercury wins the day. Thus\\ndoes Maier eulogise it: “Thou art the miracle, splendour and light of\\nthe world. Thou art the glory, ornament, and supporter of the Earth.\\nThou art the Asyle, Anchor, and tye of the Universe. Next to the minde\\nof Man, God Created nothing more Noble, more Glorious, or more\\nProfitable.”[75] His _Subtle Allegory concerning the Secrets of Alchemy,\\nvery useful to possess and pleasant to read_, will be found in the\\n_Hermetic Museum_, together with his _Golden Tripod_, consisting of\\ntranslations of “Valentine’s” “_Practica_” and _Twelve Keys_, Norton’s\\n_Ordinal_ and Cremer’s spurious _Testament_.\\n\\n    [75] MICHAEL MAIER: _Lusus Serius: or Serious Passe-time_ (1654), p.\\n    138.\\n\\n[Illustration: Plate 11.\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF JACOB BOEHME.\\n\\n_To face page 74_]]\\n\\n\\nJacob Boehme (1575-1624.)\\n\\n§ =56.= =Jacob Boehme=, or Behmen (see plate 11), was born at Alt\\nSeidenberg, a village near Görlitz, in 1575. His parents being poor, the\\neducation he received was of a very rudimentary nature, and when his\\nschooling days were over, Jacob was apprenticed to a shoemaker. His\\nreligious nature caused him often to admonish his fellow-apprentices,\\nwhich behaviour ultimately caused him to be dismissed. He travelled\\nabout as a journeyman shoemaker, returning, however, to Görlitz in 1594,\\nwhere he married and settled in business. He claims to have experienced\\na wonderful vision in 1598, and to have had a similar vision two years\\nlater. In these visions, the first of which lasted for several days, he\\nbelieved that he saw into the inmost secrets of nature; but what at\\nfirst appeared dim and vague became clear and coherent in a third\\nvision, which he tells us was vouchsafed to him in 1610. It was then\\nthat he wrote his first book, the _Aurora_, which he composed for\\nhimself only, in order that he should not forget the mysteries disclosed\\nto him. At a later period he produced a large number of treatises of a\\nmystical-religious nature, having spent the intervening years in\\nimproving his early education. These books aroused the ire of the\\nnarrow-minded ecclesiastical authorities of the town, and Jacob suffered\\nconsiderable persecution in consequence. He visited Dresden in 1624, and\\nin the same year was there taken ill with a fever. Returning to Görlitz,\\nhe expired in a condition of ecstasy.\\n\\nJacob Boehme was an alchemist of a purely transcendental order. He had,\\nit appears, acquired some knowledge of Chemistry during his apprentice\\ndays, and he employed the language of Alchemy in the elaboration of his\\nsystem of mystical philosophy. With this lofty mystical-religious system\\nwe cannot here deal; Boehme is, indeed, often accounted the greatest of\\ntrue Christian mystics; but although conscious of his superiority over\\nmany minor lights, we think this title is due to Emanuel Swedenborg. The\\nquestion of the validity of his visions is also one which lies beyond\\nthe scope of the present work;[76] we must confine our attention to\\nBoehme as an alchemist. The Philosopher’s Stone, in Boehme’s\\nterminology, is the Spirit of Christ which must “tincture” the\\nindividual soul. In one place he says, “_The Phylosophers Stone_ is a\\nvery dark disesteemed Stone, of a _Gray_ colour, but therein lyeth the\\nhighest Tincture.”[77] In the transcendental sense, this is reminiscent\\nof the words of Isaiah: “He hath no form nor comeliness; and when we see\\nhim, there is no beauty that we should desire him. .\\xa0.\\xa0. He was despised\\nand we esteemed him not,” &c.[78]\\n\\n    [76] For a general discussion of spiritual visions see the present\\n    writer’s _Matter, Spirit and the Cosmos_ (Rider, 1910), Chapter IV.,\\n    “On Matter and Spirit.” Undoubtedly Boehme’s visions involved a\\n    valuable element of truth, but at the same time much that was purely\\n    relative and subjective.\\n\\n    [77] JACOB BOEHME: _Epistles_ (translated by J.

He devoted himself to the study of medicine, at first following\\nGalen, but afterwards accepting in part the teachings of Paracelsus;\\nand he helped to a large extent in the overthrow of the old medical\\ndoctrines. His purely chemical researches were also of great value to\\nthe science. He was a man of profound knowledge, of a religious\\ntemperament, and he possessed a marked liking for the mystical. He was\\ninspired by the writings of Thomas à Kempis to imitate Christ in all\\nthings, and he practised medicine, therefore, as a work of benevolence,\\nasking no fee for his services. At the same time, moreover, he was a\\nfirm believer in the powers of the Philosopher’s Stone, claiming to have\\nhimself successfully performed the transmutation of the metals on more\\nthan one occasion, though unacquainted with the composition of the\\nmedicine employed (see § 62). Many of his theoretical views are highly\\nfantastical. He lived a life devoted to scientific research, and died in\\n1644.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 12.\\n\\nPORTRAITS OF J. B. AND F. M. VAN HELMONT.\\n\\n(From the Frontispiece to J. B. van Helmont’s _Oriatrike_).\\n\\n_To face page 76_]]\\n\\nVan Helmont regarded water as the primary element out of which all\\nthings are produced. He denied that fire was an element or anything\\nmaterial at all, and he did not accept the sulphur-mercury-salt theory.\\nTo him is due the word “gas”--before his time various gases were looked\\nupon as mere varieties of air--and he also made a distinction between\\ngases (which could not be condensed)[79] and vapours (which give liquids\\non cooling). In particular he investigated the gas that is now known as\\ncarbon-dioxide (carbonic anhydride), which he termed _gas sylvestre_;\\nbut he lacked suitable apparatus for the collection of gases, and\\nhence was led in many cases to erroneous conclusions.\\n\\n    [79] It has since been discovered that all gases can be condensed,\\n    given a sufficient degree of cold and pressure.\\n\\n=Francis Mercurius van Helmont= (see plate 12), the son of John Baptist,\\nborn in 1618, gained the reputation of having also achieved the _magnum\\nopus_, since he appeared to live very luxuriously upon a limited income.\\nHe was a skilled chemist and physician, but held many queer theories,\\nmetempsychosis included.\\n\\n\\nJohann Rudolf Glauber (1604-1668).\\n\\n§ =58.= =Johann Rudolf Glauber= was born at Karlstadt in 1604. Of his\\nlife little is known. He appears to have travelled about Germany a good\\ndeal, afterwards visiting Amsterdam, where he died in 1668. He was of a\\nvery patriotic nature, and a most ardent investigator in the realm of\\nChemistry. He accepted the main iatro-chemical doctrines, but gave most\\nof his attention to applied Chemistry. He enriched the science with many\\nimportant discoveries; and crystallised sodium sulphate is still called\\n“Glauber’s Salt.” Glauber, himself, attributed remarkable medicinal\\npowers to this compound. He was a firm believer in the claims of\\nAlchemy, and held many fantastic ideas.\\n\\n\\nThomas Vaughan (“Eugenius Philalethes”) (1622-1666.)\\n\\n§ =59.= =Thomas Vaughan=, who wrote under the name of “=Eugenius\\nPhilalethes=,” was born at Newton in Brecknockshire in 1622.

He appears also to have taken holy\\norders and to have had the living of St. Bridget’s (Brecknockshire)\\nconferred on him.[80] During the civil wars he bore arms for the king,\\nbut his allegiance to the Royalist cause led to his being accused of\\n“drunkenness, swearing, incontinency and bearing arms for the King”; and\\nhe appears to have been deprived of his living. He retired to Oxford and\\ngave himself up to study and chemical research. He is to be regarded as\\nan alchemist of the transcendental order. His views as to the nature of\\nthe true Philosopher’s Stone may be gathered from the following\\nquotation: “This, reader,” he says, speaking of the mystical\\nillumination, “is the Christian Philosopher’s Stone, a Stone so often\\ninculcated in Scripture. This is the Rock in the wildernesse, because in\\ngreat obscurity, and few there are that know the right way unto it. This\\nis the Stone of Fire in Ezekiel; this is the Stone with Seven Eyes upon\\nit in Zacharie, and this is the White Stone with the New Name in the\\nRevelation. But in the Gospel, where Christ himself speakes, who was\\nborn to discover mysteries and communicate Heaven to Earth, it is more\\nclearly described.”[81] At the same time he appears to have carried out\\nexperiments in physical Alchemy, and is said to have met with his death\\nin 1666 through accidentally inhaling the fumes of some mercury with\\nwhich he was experimenting.\\n\\n    [80] See ANTHONY À WOOD: _Athenæ Oxonienses_, edited by Philip\\n    Bliss, vol. iii. (1817), cols. 722-726.\\n\\n    [81] THOMAS VAUGHAN (“Eugenius Philalethes”): _Anima Magica\\n    Abscondita_ (see _The Magical Writings of Thomas Vaughan_, edited by\\n    A. E. Waite, 1888, p. 71).\\n\\nThomas Vaughan was an ardent disciple of Cornelius Agrippa, the\\nsixteenth-century theosophist. He held the peripatetic philosophy in\\nvery slight esteem. He was a man devoted to God, though probably guilty\\nof some youthful follies, full of love towards his wife, and with an\\nintense desire for the solution of the great problems of Nature. Amongst\\nhis chief works, which are by no means wanting in flashes of mystic\\nwisdom, may be mentioned _Anthroposophia Theomagica_, _Anima Magica\\nAbscondita_ (which were published together), and _Magia Adamica; or, the\\nAntiquitie of Magic_. With regard to his views as expressed in the first\\ntwo of these books, a controversy ensued between Vaughan and Henry\\nMoore, which was marked by considerable acrimony.\\n\\n\\n“Eirenæus Philalethes” (1623?-?) and George Starkey (?-1665).\\n\\n§ =60.= The use of the pseudonym “Philalethes” has not been confined to\\none alchemist. The cosmopolitan adept who wrote under the name of\\n“=Eirenæus Philalethes=,” has been confused, on the one hand, with\\nThomas Vaughan, on the other hand with George Starkey (?-1665). He has\\nalso been identified with Dr. Robert Child (1613-1654); but his real\\nidentity remains shrouded in mystery.[82] =George Starkey= (or Stirk),\\nthe son of George Stirk, minister of the Church of England in Bermuda,\\ngraduated at Harvard in 1646 and practised medicine in the United States\\nof America from 1647 to 1650. In 1651 he came to England and practised\\nmedicine in London. He died of the plague in 1665. In 1654-5 he\\npublished _The Marrow of Alchemy_, by “Eirenæus Philoponos\\nPhilalethes,” which some think he had stolen from his Hermetic Master.\\nOther works by “Eirenæus Philalethes” appeared after Starkey’s death and\\nbecame immensely popular. The _Open Entrance to the Closed Palace of the\\nKing_ (the most famous of these) and the _Three Treatises_ of the same\\nauthor will be found in _The Hermetic Museum_. Some of his views have\\nalready been noted (see §§ 1 and 22). On certain points he differed from\\nthe majority of the alchemists. He denied that fire was an element, and,\\nalso, that bodies are formed by mixture of the elements. According to\\nhim there is one principle in the metals, namely, mercury, which arises\\nfrom the aqueous element, and is termed “metalically differentiated\\nwater, _i.e._, it is water passed into that stage of development, in\\nwhich it can no longer produce anything but mineral substances.”[83]\\nPhilalethes’s views as to “metallic seed” are also of considerable\\ninterest. Of the seed of gold, which he regarded as the seed, also, of\\nall other metals, he says: “The seed of animals and vegetables is\\nsomething separate, and may be cut out, or otherwise separately\\nexhibited; but metallic seed is diffused throughout the metal, and\\ncontained in all its smallest parts; neither can it be discerned from\\nits body: its extraction is therefore a task which may well tax the\\ningenuity of the most experienced philosopher. .\\xa0.\\xa0.”[84] Well might\\nthis have been said of the electron of modern scientific theory.\\n\\n    [82] See Mr. A. E. Waite’s _Lives of Alchemystical Philosophers_,\\n    art. “Eirenæus Philalethes,” and the Biographical Preface to his\\n    _The Works of Thomas Vaughan_ (1919); also the late Professor\\n    Ferguson’s “‘The Marrow of Alchemy’,” _The Journal of The Alchemical\\n    Society_, vol. iii. (1915), pp. 106 _et seq._, and Professor G. L.\\n    Kittredge’s _Doctor Robert Child, The Remonstrant_ (Camb., Mass.,\\n    1919). The last mentioned writer strongly urges the identification\\n    of “Eirenæus Philalethes” with George Starkey.\\n\\n    [83] “EIRENÆUS PHILALETHES”: _The Metamorphosis of Metals_ (see _The\\n    Hermetic Museum_, vol. ii. p. 236).

That many _apparent_ transmutations\\noccurred, the observers being either self-deceived by a superficial\\nexamination--certain alloys resemble the “noble metals”--or deliberately\\ncheated by impostors, is of course undoubted. But at the same time we\\nmust not assume that, because we know not the method now, real\\ntransmutations have never taken place. Modern research indicates that it\\nmay be possible to transmute other metals, such as lead or bismuth, into\\ngold, and consequently we must admit the possibility that amongst the\\nmany experiments carried out, a real transmutation was effected. On the\\nother hand, the method which is suggested by the recent researches in\\nquestion could not have been known to the alchemists or accidentally\\nemployed by them; and, moreover, the quantity of gold which is hoped\\nfor, should such a method prove successful, is far below the smallest\\namount that would have been detected in the days of Alchemy. But if\\nthere be one method whereby the metals may be transmuted, there may be\\nother methods. And it is not altogether an easy task to explain away the\\ntestimony of eminent men such as were van Helmont and Helvetius.\\n\\n\\nThe Testimony of van Helmont.\\n\\n§ =62.= =John Baptist van Helmont= (see § 57), who was celebrated alike\\nfor his skill as a physician and chemist and for his nobility of\\ncharacter, testified in more than one place that he had himself carried\\nout the transmutation of mercury into gold. But, as we have mentioned\\nabove, the composition of the Stone employed on these occasions was\\nunknown to him. He says: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. For truly, I have divers times seen it\\n[the Stone of the Philosophers], and handled it with my hands: but it\\nwas of colour, such as is in Saffron in its Powder, yet weighty, and\\nshining like unto powdered Glass: There was once given unto me one\\nfourth part of one Grain: But I call a Grain the six hundredth part of\\none Ounce: This quarter of one Grain therefore, being rouled up in\\nPaper, I projected upon eight Ounces of Quick-silver made hot in a\\nCrucible; and straightway all the Quick-silver, with a certain degree of\\nNoise, stood still from flowing, and being congealed, setled like unto a\\nyellow Lump: but after pouring it out, the Bellows blowing, there were\\nfound eight Ounces, and a little less than eleven Grains [eight Ounces\\nless eleven Grains] of the purest Gold: Therefore one only Grain of that\\nPowder, had transchanged 19186 [19156] Parts of Quick-silver, equal to\\nitself, into the best Gold.”[85]\\n\\n    [85] J. B. VAN HELMONT: _Life Eternal_ (see _Oriatrike_, translated\\n    by J. C., 1662; or _van Helmont’s Workes_, translated by J. C.,\\n    1664, which is merely the former work with a new title-page and\\n    preliminary matter, pp. 751 and 752).\\n\\nAnd again: “I am constrained to believe that there is the Stone which\\nmakes Gold, and which makes Silver; because I have at distinct turns,\\nmade projection with my hand, of one grain of the Powder, upon some\\nthousand grains of hot Quick-silver; and the buisiness succeeded in the\\nFire, even as Books do promise; a Circle of many People standing by,\\ntogether with a tickling Admiration of us all. .\\xa0.\\xa0. He who first gave\\nme the Gold-making Powder, had likewise also, at least as much of it, as\\nmight be sufficient for changing two hundred thousand Pounds of Gold:\\n.\\xa0.\\xa0. For he gave me perhaps half a grain of that Powder, and nine\\nounces and three quarters of Quick-silver were thereby transchanged: But\\nthat Gold, a strange man [a stranger], being a Friend of one evenings\\nacquaintance, gave me.”[86]\\n\\n    [86] J. B. VAN HELMONT: _The Tree of Life_ (see _Oriatrike_ or _Van\\n    Helmont’s Workes_, p. 807).\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 13.\\n\\n_To face page 84_]]\\n\\n\\nThe Testimony of Helvetius.\\n\\n§ =63.= =John Frederick Helvetius= (see plate 13), an eminent doctor of\\nmedicine, and physician to the Prince of Orange, published at the Hague\\nin 1667 the following remarkable account of a transmutation he claimed\\nto have effected. Certain points of resemblance between this account and\\nthat of van Helmont (_e.g._, in each case the Stone is described as a\\nglassy substance of a pale yellow colour) are worth noticing: “On the 27\\nDecember, 1666, in the forenoon, there came to my house a certain man,\\nwho was a complete stranger to me, but of an honest, grave countenance,\\nand an authoritative mien, clothed in a simple garb like that of a\\nMemnonite. .\\xa0.\\xa0.\\n\\n“After we had exchanged salutations, he asked me whether he might have\\nsome conversation with me. He wished to say something to me about the\\nPyrotechnic Art, as he had read one of my tracts (directed against the\\nsympathetic Powder of Dr. Digby), in which I hinted a suspicion whether\\nthe Grand Arcanum of the Sages was not after all a gigantic hoax. He,\\ntherefore, took that opportunity of asking me whether I could not\\nbelieve that such a grand mystery might exist in the nature of things,\\nby means of which a physician could restore any patient whose vitals\\nwere not irreparably destroyed. I answered: ‘Such a Medicine would be a\\nmost desirable acquisition for any physician; nor can any man tell how\\nmany secrets there may be hidden in Nature; yet, though I have read much\\nabout the truth of this Art, it has never been my good fortune to meet\\nwith a real Master of the Alchemical Science.’ I also enquired whether\\nhe was a medical man. .\\xa0.\\xa0. In reply, he .\\xa0.\\xa0. described himself as a\\nbrassfounder. .\\xa0.\\xa0. After some further conversation, the Artist Elias\\n(for it was he) thus addressed me: ‘Since you have read so much in the\\nworks of the Alchemists about this Stone, its substance, its colour, and\\nits wonderful effects, may I be allowed the question, whether you have\\nnot yourself prepared it?’ On my answering his question in the negative,\\nhe took out of his bag a cunningly-worked ivory box, in which there were\\nthree large pieces of a substance resembling glass, or pale sulphur, and\\ninformed me that here was enough of the Tincture for the production of\\n20 tons of gold. When I had held the precious treasure in my hand for\\na quarter of an hour (during which time I listened to a recital of its\\nwonderful curative properties), I was compelled to restore it to its\\nowner, which I could not help doing with a certain degree of reluctance.\\nAfter thanking him for his kindness in shewing it to me, I then asked\\nhow it was that his Stone did not display that ruby colour, which I had\\nbeen taught to regard as characteristic of the Philosopher’s Stone. He\\nreplied that the colour made no difference, and that the substance was\\nsufficiently mature for all practical purposes. My request that he would\\ngive me a piece of his Stone (though it were no larger than a coriander\\nseed), he somewhat brusquely refused, adding, in a milder tone, that he\\ncould not give it me for all the wealth I possessed, and that not on\\naccount of its great preciousness, but for some other reason which it\\nwas not lawful for him to divulge; .\\xa0.\\xa0.\\n\\n\\nHelvetius obtains the Philosopher’s Stone.\\n\\n§ =64.= “When my strange visitor had concluded his narrative, I besought\\nhim to give me a proof of his assertion, by performing the transmutatory\\noperation on some metals in my presence. He answered evasively, that he\\ncould not do so then, but that he would return in three weeks, and that,\\nif he was then at liberty to do so, he would shew me something that\\nwould make me open my eyes. He appeared punctually to the promised day,\\nand invited me to take a walk with him, in the course of which we\\ndiscoursed profoundly on the secrets of Nature in fire, though I noticed\\nthat my companion was very chary in imparting information about the\\nGrand Arcanum. .\\xa0.\\xa0. At last I asked him point-blank to show me the\\ntransmutation of metals. I besought him to come and dine with me, and to\\nspend the night at my house; I entreated; I expostulated; but in vain.\\nHe remained firm. I reminded him of his promise. He retorted that his\\npromise had been conditional upon his being permitted to reveal the\\nsecret to me. At last, however, I prevailed upon him to give me a piece\\nof his precious Stone--a piece no larger than a grain of rape seed. He\\ndelivered it to me as if it were the most princely donation in the\\nworld. Upon my uttering a doubt whether it would be sufficient to tinge\\nmore than four grains of lead, he eagerly demanded it back. I complied,\\nin the hope that he would exchange it for a larger piece; instead of\\nwhich he divided it in two with his thumb, threw away one-half and gave\\nme back the other, saying: ‘Even now it is sufficient for you.’ Then I\\nwas still more heavily disappointed, as I could not believe that\\nanything could be done with so small a particle of the Medicine. He,\\nhowever, bade me take two drachms, or half an ounce of lead, or even a\\nlittle more, and to melt it in the crucible; for the Medicine would\\ncertainly not tinge more of the base metal than it was sufficient for. I\\nanswered that I could not believe that so small a quantity of Tincture\\ncould transform so large a mass of lead. But I had to be satisfied with\\nwhat he had given me, and my chief difficulty was about the application\\nof the Tincture. I confessed that when I held his ivory box in my hand,\\nI had managed to extract a few crumbs of his Stone, but that they had\\nchanged my lead, not into gold, but only into glass. He laughed, and\\nsaid that I was more expert at theft than at the application of the\\nTincture. ‘You should have protected your spoil with “yellow wax,” then\\nit would have been able to penetrate the lead and to transmute it into\\ngold.’ .\\xa0.\\xa0.\\n\\n\\nHelvetius performs a Transmutation.\\n\\n§ =65.= “.\\xa0.\\xa0. With .\\xa0.\\xa0. a promise to return at nine o’clock the next\\nmorning, he left me. But at the stated hour on the following day he did\\nnot make his appearance; in his stead, however, there came, a few hours\\nlater, a stranger, who told me that his friend the Artist was\\nunavoidably detained, but that he would call at three o’clock in the\\nafternoon. The afternoon came; I waited for him till half-past seven\\no’clock. He did not appear. Thereupon my wife came and tempted me to try\\nthe transmutation myself. I determined, however, to wait till the\\nmorrow, and in the meantime, ordered my son to light the fire, as I was\\nnow almost sure that he was an impostor. On the morrow, however, I\\nthought that I might at least make an experiment with the piece of\\n‘Tincture’ which I had received; if it turned out a failure, in spite of\\nmy following his directions closely, I might then be quite certain that\\nmy visitor had been a mere pretender to a knowledge of this Art. So I\\nasked my wife to put the Tincture in wax, and I myself, in the meantime,\\nprepared six drachms of lead; I then cast the Tincture, enveloped as it\\nwas in wax, on the lead; as soon as it was melted, there was a hissing\\nsound and a slight effervescence, and after a quarter of an hour I found\\nthat the whole mass of lead had been turned into the finest gold. Before\\nthis transmutation took place, the compound became intensely green, but\\nas soon as I had poured it into the melting pot it assumed a hue like\\nblood. When it cooled, it glittered and shone like gold. We immediately\\ntook it to the goldsmith, who at once declared it to be the finest gold\\nhe had ever seen, and offered to pay fifty florins an ounce for it.\\n\\n\\nHelvetius’s Gold Assayed.\\n\\n§ =66.= “The rumour, of course, spread at once like wildfire through the\\nwhole city; and in the afternoon, I had visits from many illustrious\\nstudents of this Art; I also received a call from the Master of the Mint\\nand some other gentlemen, who requested me to place at their disposal a\\nsmall piece of the gold, in order that they might subject it to the\\nusual tests. I consented, and we betook ourselves to the house of a\\ncertain silversmith, named Brechtil, who submitted a small piece of my\\ngold to the test called ‘the fourth’: three or four parts of silver are\\nmelted in the crucible with one part of gold, and then beaten out into\\nthin plates, upon which some strong _aqua fortis_ [nitric acid] is\\npoured. The usual result of this experiment is that the silver is\\ndissolved, while the gold sinks to the bottom in the shape of a black\\npowder, and after the _aqua fortis_ has been poured off, [the gold,]\\nmelted once again in the crucible, resumes its former shape. .\\xa0.\\xa0. When\\nwe now performed this experiment, we thought at first that one-half of\\nthe gold had evaporated; but afterwards we found that this was not the\\ncase, but that, on the contrary, two scruples of the silver had\\nundergone a change into gold.\\n\\n\\nHelvetius’s Gold Further Tested.\\n\\n§ =67.= “Then we tried another test, _viz._, that which is performed by\\nmeans of a septuple of Antimony; at first it seemed as if eight grains\\nof the gold had been lost, but afterwards, not only had two scruples of\\nthe silver been converted into gold, but the silver itself was greatly\\nimproved both in quality and malleability. Thrice I performed this\\ninfallible test, discovering that every drachm of gold produced an\\nincrease of a scruple of gold, but the silver is excellent and extremely\\nflexible. Thus I have unfolded to you the whole story from beginning to\\nend. The gold I still retain in my possession, but I cannot tell you\\nwhat has become of the Artist Elias. Before he left me, on the last day\\nof our friendly intercourse, he told me that he was on the point of\\nundertaking a journey to the Holy Land. May the Holy Angels of God watch\\nover him wherever he is, and long preserve him as a source of blessing\\nto Christendom! This is my earnest prayer on his and our behalf.”[87]\\n\\n    [87] J. F. HELVETIUS: _The Golden Calf_, ch. iii. (see _The Hermetic\\n    Museum_, vol. ii. pp. 283 _et seq._).\\n\\nTestimony such as this warns us not to be too sure that a real\\ntransmutation has never taken place. On the whole, with regard to this\\nquestion, an agnostic position appears to be the more philosophical.\\n\\n\\nThe Genesis of Chemistry.\\n\\n§ =68.= But even if the alchemists did not discover the Grand Arcanum of\\nNature, they did discover very many scientifically important facts. Even\\nif they did not prepare the Philosopher’s Stone, they did prepare a very\\nlarge number of new and important chemical compounds. Their labours were\\nthe seeds out of which modern Chemistry developed, and this highly\\nimportant science is rightfully included under the expression “The\\nOutcome of Alchemy.” As we have already pointed out (§ 48), it was the\\niatro-chemists who first investigated chemical matters with an object\\nother than alchemistic, their especial end in view being the\\npreparation of useful medicines, though the medical-chemist and the\\nalchemist were very often united in the one person, as in the case of\\nParacelsus himself and the not less famous van Helmont. It was not until\\nstill later that Chemistry was recognised as a distinct science separate\\nfrom medicine.\\n\\n\\nThe Degeneracy of Alchemy.\\n\\n§ =69.= In another direction the Outcome of Alchemy was of a very\\ndistressing nature. Alchemy was in many respects eminently suitable as a\\ncloak for fraud, and those who became “alchemists” with the sole object\\nof accumulating much wealth in a short space of time, finding that the\\nlegitimate pursuit of the Art did not enable them to realise their\\nexpectations in this direction, availed themselves of this fact. There\\nis, indeed, some evidence that the degeneracy of Alchemy had commenced\\nas early as the fourteenth century, but the attainment of the _magnum\\nopus_ was regarded as possible for some three or more centuries.\\n\\nThe alchemistic promises of health, wealth and happiness and a\\npseudo-mystical style of language were effectively employed by these\\nimpostors. Some more or less ingenious tricks--such as the use of hollow\\nstirring-rods, in which the gold was concealed, &c.--convinced a\\ncredulous public of the validity of their claims. Of these\\npseudo-alchemists we have already made the acquaintance of Edward\\nKelley, but chief of them all is generally accounted the notorious\\n“Count Cagliostro.” That “Cagliostro” is rightfully placed in the\\ncategory of pseudo-alchemists is certain, but it also appears equally\\ncertain that, charlatan though he was, posterity has not always done\\nhim that justice which is due to all men, however bad they may be.\\n\\n\\n“Count Cagliostro” (--?-1795).\\n\\n§ =70.= Of the birth and early life of the personage calling himself\\n“=Count Cagliostro=” nothing is known with any degree of certainty, even\\nhis true name being enveloped in mystery. It has, indeed, been usual to\\nidentify him with the notorious Italian swindler, Giuseppe Balsamo, who,\\nborn at Palermo in 1743 (or 1748), apparently disappeared from mortal\\nken after some thirty years, of which the majority were spent in\\ncommitting various crimes. “Cagliostro’s” latest biographer,[88] who\\nappears to have gone into the matter very thoroughly, however, throws\\nvery grave doubts on the truth of this theory.\\n\\n    [88] W. R. H. TROWBRIDGE: _Cagliostro_: _The Splendour and Misery of\\n    a Master of Magic_ (1910). We must acknowledge our indebtedness for\\n    many of the particulars which follow to this work. It is, however,\\n    unfortunately marred by a ridiculous attempt to show a likeness\\n    between “Cagliostro” and Swedenborg, for which, by the way, Mr.\\n    Trowbridge has already been criticised by the _Spectator_. It may\\n    justly be said of Swedenborg that he was scrupulously honest and\\n    sincere in his beliefs as well as in his actions; and, as a\\n    philosopher, it is only now being discovered how really great he\\n    was. He did, indeed, claim to have converse with spiritual beings;\\n    but the results of modern psychical research have robbed such claims\\n    of any inherent impossibility, and in Swedenborg’s case there is\\n    very considerable evidence for their validity.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 14.\\n\\n_To face page 92_]]\\n\\nIf the earlier part of “Cagliostro’s” life is unknown, the latter part\\nis so overlaid with legends and lies, that it is almost impossible to\\nget at the truth concerning it. In 1776 Cagliostro and his wife were in\\nLondon, where “Cagliostro” became a Freemason, joining a lodge connected\\nwith “The Order of Strict Observance,” a secret society incorporated\\nwith Freemasonry, and which (on the Continent, at least) was concerned\\nlargely with occult subjects. “Cagliostro,” however, was unsatisfied\\nwith its rituals and devised a new system which he called Egyptian\\nMasonry. Egyptian Masonry, he taught, was to reform the whole world, and\\nhe set out, leaving England for the Continent, to convert Masons and\\nothers to his views. We must look for the motive power of his\\nextraordinary career in vanity and a love of mystery-mongering, without\\nany true knowledge of the occult; it is probable, indeed, that\\nultimately his unbounded vanity triumphed over his reason and that he\\nactually believed in his own pretensions. That he did possess hypnotic\\nand clairvoyant powers is, we think, at least probable; but it is none\\nthe less certain that, when such failed him, he had no scruples against\\nemploying other means of convincing the credulous of the validity of his\\nclaims. This was the case on his visit to Russia, which occurred not\\nlong afterwards. At St. Petersburg a youthful medium he was employing,\\nto put the matter briefly, “gave the show away,” and at Warsaw, where he\\nfound it necessary to turn alchemist, he was detected in the process of\\nintroducing a piece of gold in the crucible containing the base metal he\\nwas about to “transmute.” At Strasburg, which he reached in 1780,\\nhowever, he was more successful. Here he appeared as a miraculous healer\\nof all diseases, though whether his cures are to be ascribed to some\\nsimple but efficacious medicine which he had discovered, to hypnotism,\\nto the power of the imagination on the part of his patients, or to the\\npower of imagination on the part of those who have recorded the alleged\\ncures, is a question into which we do not propose to enter. At\\nStrasburg “Cagliostro” came into contact with the Cardinal de Rohan, and\\na fast friendship sprang up between the two, which, in the end, proved\\n“Cagliostro’s” ruin. The “Count” next visited Bordeaux and Lyons,\\nsuccessfully founding lodges of Egyptian Masonry. From the latter town\\nhe proceeded to Paris, where he reached the height of his fame. He\\nbecame extraordinarily rich, although he is said to have asked, and to\\nhave accepted, no fee for his services as a healer. On the other hand,\\nthere was a substantial entrance-fee to the mysteries of Egyptian\\nMasonry, which, with its alchemistic promises of health and wealth,\\nprospered exceedingly. At the summit of his career, however, fortune\\nforsook him. As a friend of de Rohan, he was arrested in connection with\\nthe Diamond Necklace affair, on the word of the infamous Countess de\\nLamotte; although, of whatever else he may have been guilty, he was\\nperfectly innocent of this charge. After lying imprisoned in the\\nBastille for several months, he was tried by the French Parliament,\\npronounced innocent, and released. Immediately, however, the king\\nbanished him, and he left Paris for London, where he seems to have been\\npersistently persecuted by agents of the French king. He returned to the\\nContinent, ultimately reaching Italy, where he was arrested by the\\nInquisition and condemned to death on the charge of being a Freemason (a\\ndire offence in the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church). The sentence,\\nhowever, was modified to one of perpetual imprisonment, and he was\\nconfined in the Castle of San Leo, where he died in 1795, after four\\nyears of imprisonment, in what manner is not known.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nTHE AGE OF MODERN CHEMISTRY\\n\\n\\nThe Birth of Modern Chemistry.\\n\\n§ =71.= Chemistry as distinct from Alchemy and Iatro-chemistry commenced\\nwith Robert Boyle (see plate 15), who first clearly recognised that its\\naim is neither the transmutation of the metals nor the preparation of\\nmedicines, but the observation and generalisation of a certain class of\\nphenomena; who denied the validity of the alchemistic view of the\\nconstitution of matter, and enunciated the definition of an element\\nwhich has since reigned supreme in Chemistry; and who enriched the\\nscience with observations of the utmost importance. Boyle, however, was\\na man whose ideas were in advance of his times, and intervening between\\nthe iatro-chemical period and the Age of Modern Chemistry proper came\\nthe period of the Phlogistic Theory--a theory which had a certain\\naffinity with the ideas of the alchemists.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 15.\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF ROBERT BOYLE.\\n\\n_To face page 94_]]\\n\\n\\nThe Phlogiston Theory.\\n\\n§ =72.= The phlogiston theory was mainly due to Georg Ernst Stahl\\n(1660-1734). Becher (1635-1682) had attempted to revive the once\\nuniversally accepted sulphur-mercury-salt theory of the alchemists in a\\nsomewhat modified form, by the assumption that all substances consist of\\nthree earths--the combustible, mercurial, and vitreous; and herein is\\nto be found the germ of Stahl’s phlogistic theory. According to Stahl,\\nall combustible bodies (including those metals that change on heating)\\ncontain _phlogiston_, the principle of combustion, which escapes in the\\nform of flame when such substances are burned. According to this theory,\\ntherefore, the metals are compounds, since they consist of a metallic\\ncalx (what we now call the “oxide” of the metal) combined with\\nphlogiston; and, further, to obtain the metal from the calx it is only\\nnecessary to act upon it with some substance rich in phlogiston. Now,\\ncoal and charcoal are both almost completely combustible, leaving very\\nlittle residue; hence, according to this theory, they must consist very\\nlargely of phlogiston; and, as a matter of fact, metals can be obtained\\nby heating their calces with either of these substances. Many other\\nfacts of a like nature were explicable in terms of the phlogiston\\ntheory, and it became exceedingly popular. Chemists at this time did not\\npay much attention to the balance; it was observed, however, that metals\\nincreased in weight on calcination, but this was “explained” on the\\nassumption that phlogiston possessed negative weight. Antoine Lavoisier\\n(1743-1794), utilising Priestley’s discovery of oxygen (called\\n“dephlogisticated air” by its discoverer) and studying the weight\\nrelations accompanying combustion, demonstrated the non-validity of the\\nphlogistic theory[89] and proved combustion to be the combination of the\\nsubstance burnt with a certain constituent of the air, the oxygen. By\\nthis time Alchemy was to all intents and purposes defunct, Boerhave\\n(1668-1738) was the last eminent chemist to give any support to its\\ndoctrines, and the new chemistry of Lavoisier gave it a final\\ndeath-blow. We now enter upon the Age of Modern Chemistry, but we shall\\ndeal in this chapter with the history of chemical theory only so far as\\nis necessary in pursuance of our primary object, and hence our account\\nwill be very far from complete.\\n\\n    [89] It should be noted, however, that if by the term “phlogiston”\\n    we were to understand energy and not some form of matter, most of\\n    the statements of the phlogistics would be true so far as they go.\\n\\n\\nBoyle and the Definition of an Element.\\n\\n§ =73.= Robert Boyle (1626-1691) had defined an element as a substance\\nwhich could not be decomposed, but which could enter into combination\\nwith other elements giving compounds capable of decomposition into these\\noriginal elements. Hence, the metals were classed among the elements,\\nsince they had defied all attempts to decompose them. Now, it must be\\nnoted that this definition is of a negative character, and, although it\\nis convenient to term “elements” all substances which have so far defied\\ndecomposition, it is a matter of impossibility to decide what substances\\nare true elements with absolute certainty; and the possibility, however\\nfaint, that gold and other metals are of a compound nature, and hence\\nthe possibility of preparing gold from the “base” metals or other\\nsubstances, must always remain. This uncertainty regarding the elements\\nappears to have generally been recognised by the new school of chemists,\\nbut this having been so, it is the more surprising that their criticism\\nof alchemistic art was not less severe.\\n\\n\\nThe Stoichiometric Laws.\\n\\n§ =74.= With the study of the relative weights in which substances\\ncombine, certain generalisations or “natural laws” of supreme importance\\nwere discovered. These stoichiometric laws, as they are called, are as\\nfollows:--\\n\\n1. “The Law of Constant Proportion”--_The same chemical compound always\\ncontains the same elements, and there is a constant ratio between the\\nweights of the constituent elements present._\\n\\n2. “The Law of Multiple Proportions”--_If two substances combine\\nchemically in more than one proportion, the weights of the one which\\ncombine with a given weight of the other, stand in a simple rational\\nratio to one another._\\n\\n3. “The Law of Combining Weights”--_Substances combine either in the\\nratio of their combining numbers, or in simple rational multiples or\\nsubmultiples of these numbers._ (The weights of different substances\\nwhich combine with a given weight of some particular substance, which is\\ntaken as the unit, are called the combining numbers of such substances\\nwith reference to this unit. The usual unit now chosen is 8 grammes of\\nOxygen.)[90]\\n\\n    [90] In order that these laws may hold good, it is, of course,\\n    necessary that the substances are weighed under precisely similar\\n    conditions. To state these laws in a more absolute form, we can\\n    replace the term “weight” by “mass,” or in preference, “inertia”;\\n    for the inertias of bodies are proportional to their weights,\\n    providing that they are weighed under precisely similar conditions.\\n    For a discussion of the exact significance of these terms “mass” and\\n    “inertia,” the reader is referred to the present writer’s _Matter,\\n    Spirit and the Cosmos_ (Rider, 1910), Chapter I., “On the Doctrine\\n    of the Indestructibility of Matter.”\\n\\nAs examples of these laws we may take the few following simple facts:--\\n\\n1. Pure water is found always to consist of oxygen and hydrogen combined\\nin the ratio of 1·008 parts by weight of the latter to 8 parts by weight\\nof the former; and pure sulphur-dioxide, to take another example, is\\nfound always to consist of sulphur and oxygen combined in the ratio of\\n8·02 parts by weight of sulphur to 8 parts by weight of oxygen. (The Law\\nof Constant Proportion.)\\n\\n2. Another compound is known consisting only of oxygen and hydrogen,\\nwhich, however, differs entirely in its properties from water. It is\\nfound always to consist of oxygen and hydrogen combined in the ratio of\\n1·008 parts by weight of the latter to 16 parts by weight of the former,\\n_i.e._, in it a definite weight of hydrogen is combined with an amount\\nof oxygen _exactly twice_ that which is combined with the same weight of\\nhydrogen in water. No definite compound has been discovered with a\\nconstitution intermediate between these two. Other compounds consisting\\nonly of sulphur and oxygen are also known. One of these (viz.,\\nsulphur-trioxide, or sulphuric anhydride) is found always to consist of\\nsulphur and oxygen combined in the ratio of 5·35 parts by weight of\\nsulphur to 8 parts by weight of oxygen. We see, therefore, that the\\nweights of sulphur combined with a definite weight of oxygen in the two\\ncompounds called respectively “sulphur-dioxide” and “sulphur-trioxide,”\\nare in the proportion of 8·02 to 5·35, _i.e._, 3\\xa0:\\xa02. Similar simple\\nratios are obtained in the case of all the other compounds. (The Law of\\nMultiple Proportions.)\\n\\n3. From the data given in (1) above we can fix the combining number of\\nhydrogen as 1·008, that of sulphur as 8·02. Now, compounds are known\\ncontaining sulphur and hydrogen, and, in each case, the weight of\\nsulphur combined with 1·008 grammes of hydrogen is found always to be\\neither 8·02 grammes or some multiple or submultiple of this quantity.\\nThus, in the simplest compound of this sort, containing only hydrogen\\nand sulphur (viz., sulphuretted-hydrogen or hydrogen sulphide), 1·008\\ngrammes of hydrogen is found always to be combined with 16·04 grammes of\\nsulphur, _i.e._, exactly twice the above quantity. (The Law of Combining\\nWeights.)\\n\\nBerthollet (1748-1822) denied the truth of the law of constant\\nproportion, and a controversy ensued between this chemist and Proust\\n(1755-1826), who undertook a research to settle the question, the\\nresults of which were in entire agreement with the law, and were\\nregarded as completely substantiating it.\\n\\n[Illustration: PLATE 16.\\n\\n[by Worthington, after Allen]\\n\\nPORTRAIT OF JOHN DALTON.\\n\\n_To face page 100_]]\\n\\n\\nDalton’s Atomic Theory.\\n\\n§ =75.= At the beginning of the nineteenth century, John Dalton (see\\nplate 15) put forward his Atomic Theory in explanation of these facts.\\nThis theory assumes (1) that all matter is made up of small indivisible\\nand indestructible particles, called “atoms”; (2) that all atoms are\\n_not_ alike, there being as many different sorts of atoms as there are\\nelements; (3) that the atoms constituting any one element are exactly\\nalike and are of definite weight; and (4) that compounds are produced by\\nthe combination of different atoms. Now, it is at once evident that if\\nmatter be so constituted, the stoichiometric laws must necessarily\\nfollow. For the smallest particle of any definite compound (now called a\\n“molecule”) must consist of a definite assemblage of different atoms,\\nand these atoms are of definite weight: whence the law of constant\\nproportion. One atom of one substance may combine with 1, 2, 3 .\\xa0.\\xa0.\\natoms of some other substance, but it cannot combine with some\\nfractional part of an atom, since the atoms are indivisible: whence the\\nlaw of multiple proportions. And these laws holding good, and the atoms\\nbeing of definite weight, the law of combining weights necessarily\\nfollows. Dalton’s Atomic Theory gave a simple and intelligible\\nexplanation of these remarkable facts regarding the weights of\\nsubstances entering into chemical combination, and, therefore, gained\\nuniversal acceptance. But throughout the history of Chemistry can be\\ndiscerned a spirit of revolt against it as an explanation of the\\nabsolute constitution of matter. The tendency of scientific philosophy\\nhas always been towards Monism as opposed to Dualism, and here were not\\nmerely two eternals, but several dozen; Dalton’s theory denied the unity\\nof the Cosmos, it lacked the unifying principle of the alchemists. It is\\nonly in recent times that it has been recognised that a scientific\\nhypothesis may be very useful without being altogether true. As to the\\nusefulness of Dalton’s theory there can be no question; it has\\naccomplished that which no other hypothesis could have done; it rendered\\nthe concepts of a chemical element, a chemical compound and a chemical\\nreaction definite; and has, in a sense, led to the majority of the\\ndiscoveries in the domain of Chemistry that have been made since its\\nenunciation. But as an expression of absolute truth, Dalton’s theory, as\\nis very generally recognised nowadays, fails to be satisfactory. In the\\npast, however, it has been the philosophers of the materialistic school\\nof thought, rather than the chemists _quâ_ chemists, who have\\ninsisted on the absolute truth of the Atomic Theory; Kekulé, who by\\ndeveloping Franklin’s theory of atomicity or valency[91] made still more\\ndefinite the atomic view of matter, himself expressed grave doubts as to\\nthe absolute truth of Dalton’s theory; but he regarded it as\\n_chemically_ true, and thus voices what appears to be the opinion of the\\nmajority of chemists nowadays, namely, there are such things as chemical\\natoms and chemical elements, incapable of being decomposed by purely\\nchemical means, but that such are not absolute atoms or absolute\\nelements, and consequently not impervious to all forms of action. But\\nof this more will be said later.\\n\\n    [91] The term “valency” is not altogether an easy one to define; we\\n    will, however, here do our best to make plain its significance. In a\\n    definite chemical compound we must assume that the atoms\\n    constituting each molecule are in some way bound together (though\\n    not, of course, rigidly), and we may speak of “bonds” or “links of\\n    affinity,” taking care, however, not to interpret such terms too\\n    literally. Now, the number of “affinity links” which one atom can\\n    exert is not unlimited; indeed, according to the valency theory as\\n    first formulated, it is fixed and constant. It is this number which\\n    is called the “valency” of the element; but it is now known that the\\n    “valency” in most cases can vary between certain limits. Hydrogen,\\n    however, appears to be invariably univalent, and is therefore taken\\n    as the unit of valency. Thus, Carbon is quadrivalent in the\\n    methane-molecule, which consists of one atom of carbon combined\\n    with four atoms of hydrogen; and Oxygen is divalent in the\\n    water-molecule, which consists of one atom of oxygen combined with\\n    two atoms of hydrogen. Hence, we should expect to find one atom of\\n    carbon combining with two of oxygen, which is the case in the\\n    carbon-dioxide--(carbonic anhydride)--molecule. For a development of\\n    the thesis, so far as the compounds of carbon are concerned, that\\n    each specific “affinity link” corresponds in general to a definite\\n    and constant amount of energy, which is evolved as heat on\\n    disruption of the bond, the reader is referred to the present\\n    writer’s monograph _On the Calculation of Thermo-Chemical Constants_\\n    (Arnold, 1909). The phenomena of valency find their explanation in\\n    modern views concerning the constitution of atoms (see § 81).\\n\\n\\nThe Determination of the Atomic Weights of the Elements.\\n\\n§ =76.= With the acceptance of Dalton’s Atomic Theory, it became\\nnecessary to determine the atomic weights of the various elements,\\n_i.e._, not the absolute atomic weights, but the relative weights of the\\nvarious atoms with reference to one of them as unit.[92] We cannot in\\nthis place enter upon a discussion of the various difficulties, both of\\nan experimental and theoretical nature, which were involved in this\\nproblem, save to remark that the correct atomic weights could be arrived\\nat only with the acceptance of Avogadro’s Hypothesis. This hypothesis,\\nwhich is to the effect that equal volumes of different gases measured at\\nthe same temperature and pressure contain an equal number of gaseous\\nmolecules, was put forward in explanation of a number of facts connected\\nwith the physical behaviour of gases; but its importance was for some\\ntime unrecognised, owing to the fact that the distinction between atoms\\nand molecules was not yet clearly drawn. A list of those chemical\\nsubstances at present recognised as “elements,” together with their\\natomic weights, will be found on pp. 106, 107.\\n\\n    [92] Since hydrogen is the lightest of all known substances, the\\n    unit, Hydrogen = 1, was at one time usually employed. However, it\\n    was seen to be more convenient to express the atomic weights in\\n    terms of the weight of the oxygen-atom, and the unit, Oxygen = 16 is\\n    now always employed. This value for the oxygen-atom was chosen so\\n    that the approximate atomic weights would in most cases remain\\n    unaltered by the change.\\n\\n\\nProut’s Hypothesis.\\n\\n§ =77.= It was observed by a chemist of the name of Prout, that, the\\natomic weight of hydrogen being taken as the unit, the atomic weights\\nof nearly all the elements approximated to whole numbers; and in 1815 he\\nsuggested as the reason for this regularity, that all the elements\\nconsist solely of hydrogen. Prout’s Hypothesis received on the whole a\\nvery favourable reception; it harmonised Dalton’s Theory with the grand\\nconcept of the unity of matter--all matter was hydrogen in essence; and\\nThomas Thomson undertook a research to demonstrate its truth. On the\\nother hand, however, the eminent Swedish chemist, Berzelius, who had\\ncarried out many atomic weight determinations, criticised both Prout’s\\nHypothesis and Thomson’s research (which latter, it is true, was\\nworthless) in most severe terms; for the hypothesis amounted to\\nthis--that the decimals in the atomic weights obtained experimentally by\\nBerzelius, after so much labour, were to be regarded as so many errors.\\nIn 1844, Marignac suggested half the hydrogen atom as the unit, for the\\nelement chlorine, with an atomic weight of 35·5, would not fit in with\\nProut’s Hypothesis as originally formulated; and later, Dumas suggested\\none-quarter. With this theoretical division of the hydrogen-atom, the\\nhypothesis lost its simplicity and charm, and was doomed to downfall.\\nRecent and most accurate atomic weight determinations show clearly that\\nthe atomic weights are not exactly whole numbers, but that,\\nnevertheless, the majority of them (if expressed in terms of O = 16 as\\nthe unit) do approximate very closely to such. The Hon. R. J. Strutt has\\nrecently calculated that the probability of this occurring, in the case\\nof certain of the commoner elements, by mere chance is exceedingly small\\n(about 1 in 1,000),[93] and several attempts to explain this remarkable\\nfact have been put forward. Modern scientific speculations concerning\\nthe constitution of atoms tend towards a modified form of Prout’s\\nhypothesis, or to the view that the atoms of other elements are, in a\\nmanner, polymerides of hydrogen and helium atoms. As has been pointed\\nout, it is possible, according to modern views, for elements of\\ndifferent atomic weight to have identical chemical properties, since\\nthese latter depend only upon the number of free electrons in the atom\\nand not at all upon the massive central nucleus. By a method somewhat\\nsimilar to that used for determining the mass of kathode particles (see\\n§ 79), but applied to positively charged particles, Sir Joseph Thomson\\nand Dr. F. W. Aston discovered that the element neon was a mixture of\\ntwo isotopic elements in unequal proportions, one having an atomic mass\\nof 20, the other (present only to a slight extent) having an atomic mass\\nof 22. Dr. Aston has perfected this method of analysing mixtures of\\nisotopes and determining their atomic masses.[94] The results are of\\ngreat interest. The atomic weight of hydrogen, 1·008, is confirmed. The\\nelements helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, phosphorus,\\nsulphur, arsenic, iodine and sodium are found to be simple bodies with\\nwhole-number atomic weights. On the other hand, boron, neon, silicon,\\nchlorine, bromine, krypton, xenon, mercury, lithium, potassium and\\nrubidium are found to be mixtures. What is specially of interest is that\\nthe indicated atomic mass of each of the constituents is a whole number.\\nThus chlorine, whose atomic weight is 35·46, is found to be a mixture of\\ntwo chemically-identical elements whose atomic weights are 35 and 37.\\nSome of the elements, _e.g._, xenon, are mixtures of more than two\\nisotopes.\\n\\n    [93] Hon. R. J. STRUTT: “On the Tendency of the Atomic Weights to\\n    approximate to Whole Numbers,” _Philosophical Magazine_, [6], vol.\\n    i. (1901), pp. 311 _et seq._\\n\\n    [94] F. W. ASTON: “Mass-spectra and Atomic Weights,” _Journal of the\\n    Chemical Society_, vol. cix. (1921), pp. 677 _et seq._\\n\\nIt is highly probable that what is true of the elements investigated by\\nDr. Aston is true of the remainder. It appears, therefore, that the\\nirregularities presented by the atomic weights of the ordinary elements,\\nwhich have so much puzzled men of science in the past, are due to the\\nfact that these elements are, in many cases, mixtures. As concerns\\nhydrogen, it is only reasonable to suppose that the close packing of\\nelectrically charged particles should give rise to a slight decrease in\\ntheir total mass, so that the atomic weights of other elements referred\\nto H = 1 should be slightly less than whole numbers, or, what is the\\nsame thing, that the atomic weight of hydrogen referred to O = 16 should\\nbe slightly more than unity.\\n\\n\\nThe “Periodic Law.”\\n\\n§ =78.= A remarkable property of the atomic weights was discovered, in\\nthe sixties, independently by Lothar Meyer and Mendeléeff. They found\\nthat the elements could be arranged in rows in the order of their atomic\\nweights so that similar elements would be found in the same columns. A\\nmodernised form of the Periodic Table will be found on pp. 106, 107. It\\nwill be noticed, for example, that the “alkali” metals, Lithium, Sodium,\\nRubidium and Cæsium, which resemble one another very closely, fall in\\nColumn 1; the “alkaline earth” metals occur together in Column 2; though\\nin each case these are accompanied by certain elements with somewhat\\ndifferent properties. Much the same holds good in the case of the other\\ncolumns of this Table; there is manifested a remarkable regularity, with\\ncertain still more remarkable divergences (see notes appended to Table\\non pp. 106, 107). This regularity exhibited by the “elements” is of\\nconsiderable importance, since it shows that, in general, the properties\\nof the “elements” are _periodic_ functions of their atomic weights; and,\\ntogether with certain other remarkable properties of the “elements,”\\ndistinguishes them sharply from the “compounds.” It may be concluded\\nwith tolerable certainty, therefore, that if the “elements” are in\\nreality of a compound nature, they are all, in general, compounds of a\\nlike nature distinct from that of other compounds.\\n\\nTHE PERIODIC TABLE OF THE CHEMICAL ELEMENTS.\\n\\n  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\\n  |   0   |   1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |   5   |   6   |   7   |   8    |\\n  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\\n  |       |[Hydro-|       |       |       |       |       |Hydro- |        |\\n  |       |gen][a]|       |       |       |       |       |gen    |        |\\n  |       |[H =   |       |       |       |       |       |H =    |        |\\n  |       |1·008] |       |       |       |       |       |1·008  |        |\\n  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\\n  |Helium |Lithium|Gluci- |Boron  |Carbon |Nitro- |Oxygen |Fluo-  |        |\\n  |       |       |num    |       |       |gen    |       |rine   |        |\\n  |He =   |Li =   |Gl =   |B =    |C =    |N =    |O =    |F =    |        |\\n  |4·00   |6·94   |9·1    |10·9   |12·005 |14·008 |16·00  |19·0   |        |\\n  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\\n  |Neon   |Sodium |Magne- |Alumin-|Silicon|Phos-  |Sulphur|Chlo-  |        |\\n  |       |       |sium   |ium    |       |phorus |       |rine   |        |\\n  |Ne =   |Na =   |Mg =   |Al =   |Si =   |P =    |S =    |Cl =   |        |\\n  |20·2   |23·00  |24·32  |27·1   |28·3   |31·04  |32·06  |35·46  |        |\\n  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\\n  |Argon  |Potas- |Calcium|Scan-  |Tita-  |Vana-  |Chro-  |Manga- |Iron    |\\n  |       |sium[b]|       |dium   |nium   |dium   |mium   |nese   |Fe =    |\\n  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |55·84[c]|\\n  |A =    |K =    |Ca =   |Sc =   |Ti =   |V =    |Cr =   |Mn =   |Cobalt  |\\n  |39·9   |39·10  |40·07  |45·1   |48·1   |51·0   |52·0   |54·93  |Co =    |\\n  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |58·97   |\\n  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |Nickel  |\\n  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |Ni =    |\\n  |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |58·68   |\\n  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\\n  |       |Copper |Zinc   |Gallium|Germa- |Arsenic|Sele-  |Bromine|        |\\n  |       |       |       |       |nium   |       |nium   |       |        |\\n  |       |Cu =   |Zn =   |Ga =   |Ge =   |As =   |Se =   |Br =   |        |\\n  |       |63·57  |65·37  |70·1   |72·5   |74·96  |79·2   |79·92  |        |\\n  +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+\\n  |Krypton|Rubi-  |Stron- |Yttrium|Zirco- |Colum- |Molyb- |   ?

The atomic weights given are those of\\n    the International Atomic Weights Committee for 1920-1. They are\\n    calculated on the basis, Oxygen = 16. The number of decimal places\\n    given in each case indicates the degree of accuracy with which each\\n    atomic weight has been determined. The letter or letters underneath\\n    the name of each element is the symbol by which it is invariably\\n    designated by chemists.\\n\\n    The number above each column indicates the valency which the\\n    elements of each group exhibit towards oxygen. Many of the elements\\n    are exceptional in this respect.\\n\\n    [a]: The exact position of Hydrogen is in dispute.\\n\\n    [b]: The positions of Argon and Potassium have been inverted in\\n    order that these elements may fall in the right columns with the\\n    elements they resemble; [d]: so also have the positions of Tellurium\\n    and Iodine.\\n\\n    [c]: The whole of “Group 8” forms an exception to the Table.\\n\\n    [e]: There are a number of ill-defined rare earth metals with atomic\\n    weights lying between those of Cerium and Tantalum. They all appear\\n    to resemble the elements of “Group 3,” so that their positions in\\n    the Table cannot be decided with accuracy.\\n\\nIt is now some years since the late Sir William Crookes attempted to\\nexplain the periodicity of the properties of the elements on the theory\\nthat they have all been evolved by a conglomerating process from some\\nprimal stuff--the protyle--consisting of very small particles. He\\nrepresented the action of this generative cause by means of a “figure of\\neight” spiral, along which the elements are placed at regular intervals,\\nso that similar elements come underneath one another, as in Mendeléeff’s\\ntable, though the grouping differs in some respects. The slope of the\\ncurve is supposed to represent the decline of some factor (_e.g._,\\ntemperature) conditioning the process, which process is assumed to be of\\na recurrent nature, like the swing of a pendulum. After the completion\\nof one swing (to keep to the illustration of a pendulum) whereby one\\nseries of elements is produced, owing to the decline of the\\nabove-mentioned factor, the same series of elements is not again the\\nresult as would otherwise be the case, but a somewhat different series\\nis produced, each member of which resembles the corresponding member of\\nthe former series. Thus, if the first series contains, for example,\\nhelium, lithium, carbon, &c., the second series will contain instead,\\nargon, potassium, titanium, &c. The whole theory, though highly\\ninteresting, is, however, by no means free from defects.\\n\\n\\nThe Corpuscular Theory of Matter.\\n\\n§ =79.= We must now turn our attention to those recent views of the\\nconstitution of matter which originated to a great extent in the\\ninvestigations of the passage of electricity through gases at very low\\npressures. It will be possible, however, on the present occasion, to\\ngive only the very briefest account of the subject; but a fuller\\ntreatment is rendered unnecessary by the fact that these and allied\\ninvestigations and the theories to which they have given rise have been\\nfully treated in several well-known works, by various authorities on the\\nsubject, which have appeared during the last few years.[95]\\n\\n    [95] We have found Prof. Harry Jones’ _The Electrical Nature of\\n    Matter and Radioactivity_ (1906), Mr. Soddy’s _Radioactivity_\\n    (1904), and Mr. Whetham’s _The Recent Development of Physical\\n    Science_ (1909) particularly interesting. Mention, of course, should\\n    also be made of the standard works of Prof. Sir J. J. Thomson and\\n    Prof. Rutherford.\\n\\nWhen an electrical discharge is passed through a high-vacuum tube,\\ninvisible rays are emitted from the kathode, generally with the\\nproduction of a greenish-yellow fluorescence where they strike the\\nglass walls of the tube. These rays are called “kathode rays.” At one\\ntime they were regarded as waves in the ether, but it was shown by Sir\\nWilliam Crookes that they consist of small electrically charged\\nparticles, moving with a very high velocity. Sir J. J. Thomson was able\\nto determine the ratio of the charge carried by these particles to their\\nmass or inertia; he found that this ratio was constant whatever gas was\\ncontained in the vacuum tube, and much greater than the corresponding\\nratio for the hydrogen ion (electrically charged hydrogen atom) in\\nelectrolysis. By a skilful method, based on the fact discovered by Mr.\\nC. T. R. Wilson, that charged particles can serve as nuclei for the\\ncondensation of water-vapour, he was further able to determine the value\\nof the electrical charge carried by these particles, which was found to\\nbe constant also, and equal to the charge carried by univalent ions,\\n_e.g._, hydrogen, in electrolysis. Hence, it follows that the mass of\\nthese kathode particles must be much smaller than the hydrogen ion, the\\nactual ratio being about 1\\xa0:\\xa01700. The first theory put forward by Sir\\nJ. J. Thomson in explanation of these facts, was that these kathode\\nparticles (“corpuscles” as he termed them) were electrically charged\\nportions of matter, much smaller than the smallest atom; and since the\\nsame sort of corpuscle is obtained whatever gas is contained in the\\nvacuum tube, it is reasonable to conclude that the corpuscle is the\\ncommon unit of all matter.\\n\\n\\nProof that the Electrons are not Matter.\\n\\n§ =80.= This eminent physicist, however, had shown mathematically that a\\ncharged particle moving with a very high velocity (approaching that of\\nlight) would exhibit an appreciable increase in mass or inertia due to\\nthe charge, the magnitude of such inertia depending on the velocity of\\nthe particle. This was experimentally verified by Kaufmann, who\\ndetermined the velocities, and the ratios between the electrical charge\\nand the inertia, of various kathode particles and similar particles\\nwhich are emitted by compounds of radium (see §§ 89 and 90). Sir J. J.\\nThomson calculated these values on the assumption that the inertia of\\nsuch particles is entirely of electrical origin, and thereby obtained\\nvalues in remarkable agreement with the experimental. There is,\\ntherefore, no reason for supposing the corpuscle to be matter at all;\\nindeed, if it were, the above agreement would not be obtained. As\\nProfessor Jones says: “Since we know things only by their properties,\\nand since all the properties of the corpuscle are accounted for by the\\nelectrical charge associated with it, why assume that the corpuscle\\ncontains anything but the electrical charge? It is obvious that there is\\nno reason for doing so.\\n\\n“_The corpuscle is, then, nothing but a disembodied electrical charge_,\\ncontaining nothing material, as we have been accustomed to use that\\nterm. It is electricity, and nothing but electricity. With this new\\nconception a new term was introduced, and, now, instead of speaking of\\nthe corpuscle we speak of the _electron_.”[96] Applying this\\nmodification to the above view of the constitution of matter, we have\\nwhat is called “the electronic theory,” namely, that the material atoms\\nconsist of electrons, or units of electricity in rapid motion; which\\namounts to this--that matter is simply an electrical phenomenon.\\n\\n    [96] H. C. JONES: _The Electrical Nature of Matter and\\n    Radioactivity_ (1906), p. 21.\\n\\n\\nThe Electronic Theory of Matter.\\n\\n§ =81.= Sir J. J. Thomson has elaborated this theory of the nature and\\nconstitution of matter; he has shown what systems of electrons would be\\nstable, and has attempted to find therein the significance of\\nMendeléeff’s generalisation and the explanation of valency. There can be\\nno doubt that there is a considerable element of truth in the electronic\\ntheory of matter; the one characteristic property of matter, _i.e._,\\ninertia, can be accounted for electrically. The fundamental difficulty\\nis that the electrons are units of negative electricity, whereas matter\\nis electrically neutral. Several theories have been put forward to\\nsurmount this difficulty. Certainly the electron is a constituent of\\nmatter; but is it the sole constituent? Recent research indicates that,\\nas already pointed out, all atoms consist of two distinct portions, a\\nmassive central nucleus, whose net charge is positive, surrounded by a\\nnumber of electrons, just sufficient to neutralize this charge. The\\npoint of greatest interest is that the indicated number of free\\nelectrons is exactly the number which expresses the position of the\\nelement in the Periodic Table, reckoning helium as 2, lithium as 3, and\\nso on; and it would seem that the chemical properties of the elements\\nare determined entirely by these electrons, and are, therefore, not,\\nstrictly speaking, periodic functions of their atomic weights, as was\\nformerly thought (§ 78), but of their atomic numbers. The exact nature\\nof the nuclei of the various atoms has yet to be determined: in the\\ncase of the atoms heavier than helium they would appear to be made up of\\nthe nuclei of hydrogen and (or) helium atoms together with--in many\\ncases--electrons insufficient in number to neutralize the positive\\ncharges associated with these.\\n\\n\\nThe Etheric Theory of Matter.\\n\\n§ =82.= The analysis of matter has been carried a step further. A\\nphilosophical view of the Cosmos involves the assumption of an\\nabsolutely continuous and homogeneous medium filling all space, for an\\nabsolute vacuum is unthinkable, and if it were supposed that the stuff\\nfilling all space is of an atomic structure, the question arises, What\\noccupies the interstices between its atoms? This ubiquitous medium is\\ntermed by the scientists of to-day “the Ether of Space.” Moreover, such\\na medium as the Ether is demanded by the phenomena of light. It appears,\\nhowever, that the ether of space has another and a still more important\\nfunction than the transmission of light: the idea that matter has its\\nexplanation therein has been developed by Sir Oliver Lodge. The evidence\\ncertainly points to the conclusion that matter is some sort of\\nsingularity in the ether, probably a stress centre. We have been too\\nmuch accustomed to think of the ether as something excessively light and\\nquite the reverse of massive or dense, in which it appears we have been\\nwrong. Sir Oliver Lodge calculates that the density of the ether is far\\ngreater than that of the most dense forms of matter; not that matter is\\nto be thought of as a rarefaction of the ether, for the ether within\\nmatter is as dense as that without. What we call matter, however, is not\\na continuous substance; it consists, rather, of a number of widely\\nseparated particles, whence its comparatively small density compared\\nwith the perfectly continuous ether. Further, if there is a difficulty\\nin conceiving how a perfect fluid like the ether can give rise to a\\nsolid body possessed of such properties as rigidity, impenetrability and\\nelasticity, we must remember that all these properties can be produced\\nby means of motion. A jet of water moving with a sufficient velocity\\nbehaves like a rigid and impenetrable solid, whilst a revolving disc of\\npaper exhibits elasticity and can act as a circular saw.[97] It appears,\\ntherefore, that the ancient doctrine of the alchemistic essence is\\nfundamentally true after all, that out of the “One Thing” all material\\nthings have been produced by adaptation or modification; and, as we have\\nalready noticed (§ 60), there also appears to be some resemblance\\nbetween the concept of the electron and that of the seed of gold, which\\nseed, it should be borne in mind, was regarded by the alchemists as the\\ncommon seed of all metals.\\n\\n    [97] See Sir OLIVER LODGE, F.R.S.: _The Ether of Space_ (1909).\\n\\n\\nFurther Evidence of the Complexity of the Atoms.\\n\\n§ =83.= There are also certain other facts which appear to demand such a\\nmodification of Dalton’s Atomic Theory as is found in the Electronic\\nTheory. One of the characteristics of the chemical elements is that each\\none gives a spectrum peculiar to itself. The spectrum of an element\\nmust, therefore, be due to its atoms, which in some way are able, at a\\nsufficiently high temperature, to act upon the ether so as to produce\\nvibrations of definite and characteristic wave-length. Now, in many\\ncases the number of lines of definite wave-length observed in such a\\nspectrum is considerable, for example, hundreds of different lines have\\nbeen observed in the arc-spectrum of iron. But it is incredible that an\\natom, if it were a simple unit, would give rise to such a number of\\ndifferent and definite vibrations, and the only reasonable conclusion is\\nthat the atoms must be complex in structure. We may here mention that\\nspectroscopic examination of various heavenly bodies leads to the\\nconclusion that there is some process of evolution at work building up\\ncomplex elements from simpler ones, since the hottest nebulæ appear to\\nconsist of but a few simple elements, whilst cooler bodies exhibit a\\ngreater complexity.\\n\\n\\nViews of Wald and Ostwald.\\n\\n§ =84.= Such modifications of the atomic theory as those we have briefly\\ndiscussed above, although profoundly modifying, and, indeed,\\ncontroverting the philosophical significance of Dalton’s theory as\\noriginally formulated, leave its chemical significance practically\\nunchanged. The atoms can be regarded no longer as the eternal,\\nindissoluble gods of Nature that they were once supposed to be; thus,\\nMaterialism is deprived of what was thought to be its scientific\\nbasis.[98] But the science of Chemistry is unaffected thereby; the atoms\\nare not the ultimate units out of which material things are built, but\\nthe atoms cannot be decomposed by purely chemical means; the “elements”\\nare not truly elemental, but _they are chemical elements_. However, the\\natomic theory has been subjected to a far more searching criticism. Wald\\nargues that substances obey the law of definite proportions because of\\nthe way in which they are prepared; chemists refuse, he says, to admit\\nany substance as a definite chemical compound unless it does obey this\\nlaw. Wald’s opinions have been supported by Professor Ostwald, who has\\nattempted to deduce the other stoichiometric laws on these grounds\\nwithout assuming any atomic hypothesis[99]; but these new ideas do not\\nappear to have gained the approval of chemists in general. It is not to\\nbe supposed that chemists will give up without a struggle a mental tool\\nof such great utility as Dalton’s theory, in spite of its defects, has\\nproved itself to be. There does seem, however, to be logic in the\\narguments of Wald and Ostwald, but the trend of recent scientific theory\\nand research does not appear to be in the direction of Wald’s views.\\nCertainly, however, it appears that, on the one hand, the atomic theory\\nis not necessitated by the so-called “stoichiometric laws”; but, on the\\nother hand, a molecular constitution of matter seems to be demanded by\\nthe phenomenon known as the “Brownian Movement,” _i.e._, the\\nspontaneous, irregular and apparently perpetual movement of microscopic\\nportions of solid matter when immersed in a liquid medium; such movement\\nappearing to be explicable only as the result of the motion of the\\nmolecules of which the liquid in question is built up.[100]\\n\\n    [98] For a critical examination of Materialism, the reader is\\n    referred to the present writer’s _Matter, Spirit and the Cosmos_\\n    (Rider, 1910), especially Chapters I. and IV.\\n\\n    [99] W.

A new science,\\nhowever, is born amongst us, closely related on the one hand to\\nChemistry, on the other to Physics, but dealing with changes more\\nprofound and reactions more deeply seated than are dealt with by either\\nof these; a science as yet without a name, unless it be the not\\naltogether satisfactory one of “Radioactivity.” It is this science, or,\\nperhaps we should say, a certain aspect of it, to which we refer (it may\\nbe fantastically) by the expression “Modern Alchemy”: the aptness of the\\ntitle we hope to make plain in the course of the present chapter.\\n\\n\\nX-rays and Becquerel rays.\\n\\n§ =86.= As is commonly known, what are called X-rays are produced when\\nan electric discharge is passed through a high-vacuum tube. It has been\\nshown that these rays are a series of irregular pulses in the ether,\\nwhich are set up when the kathode particles strike the walls of the\\nglass vacuum tube,[101] and it was found that more powerful effects can\\nbe produced by inserting a disc of platinum in the path of the kathode\\nparticles. It was M. Becquerel who first discovered that there are\\nsubstances which naturally emit radiations similar to X-rays. He found\\nthat uranium compounds affected a photographic plate from which they\\nwere carefully screened, and he also showed that these uranium\\nradiations, or “Becquerel rays,” resemble X-rays in other particulars.\\nIt was already known that certain substances fluoresce (emit light) in\\nthe dark after having been exposed to sunlight, and it was thought at\\nfirst that the above phenomenon exhibited by uranium salts was of a like\\nnature, since certain uranium salts are fluorescent; but M. Becquerel\\nfound that uranium salts which had never been exposed to sunlight were\\nstill capable of affecting a photographic plate, and that this\\nremarkable property was possessed by all uranium salts, whether\\nfluorescent or not. This phenomenon is known as “radioactivity,” and\\nbodies which exhibit it are said to be “radioactive.” Schmidt found that\\nthorium compounds possess a similar property, and Professor Rutherford\\nshowed that thorium compounds evolved also something resembling a gas.\\nHe called this an “emanation.”\\n\\n    [101] They must not be confused with the greenish-yellow\\n    phosphorescence which is also produced: the X-rays are invisible.\\n\\n\\nThe Discovery of Radium.\\n\\n§ =87.= Mme. Curie[102] determined the radioactivity of many uranium and\\nthorium compounds, and found that there was a proportion between the\\nradioactivity of such compounds and the quantity of uranium or thorium\\nin them, with the remarkable exception of certain natural ores, which\\nhad a radioactivity much in excess of the normal, and, indeed, in\\ncertain cases, much greater than pure uranium. In order to throw some\\nlight on this matter, Mme. Curie prepared one of these ores by a\\nchemical process and found that it possessed a normal radioactivity. The\\nonly logical conclusion to be drawn from these facts was that the ores\\nin question must contain some unknown, highly radioactive substance, and\\nthe Curies were able, after very considerable labour, to extract from\\npitchblende (the ore with the greatest radioactivity) minute quantities\\nof the salts of two new elements--which they named “Polonium” and\\n“Radium” respectively--both of which were extremely radioactive.\\n\\n    [102] See Madame SKLODOWSKA CURIE’S _Radio-active Substances_ (2nd\\n    ed., 1904).\\n\\nM. Debierne has obtained a third radioactive substance from pitchblende,\\nwhich he has called “Actinium.”\\n\\n\\nChemical Properties of Radium.\\n\\n§ =88.= Radium is an element resembling calcium, strontium, and barium\\nin chemical properties; its atomic weight was determined by Mme. Curie,\\nand found to be about 225, according to her first experiments; a\\nredetermination gave a slightly higher value, which has been confirmed\\nby a further investigation carried out by Sir T. E. Thorpe.[103] Radium\\ngives a characteristic spectrum, and is intensely radioactive. It\\nshould be noted that up to the middle of the year 1910 the element\\nradium itself had not been prepared; in all the experiments carried out\\nradium salts were employed (_i.e._, certain compounds of radium with\\nother elements), generally radium chloride and radium bromide. In that\\nyear, however, Mme. Curie, in conjunction with M. Debierne, obtained the\\nfree metal. It is described as a white, shining metal resembling the\\nother alkaline earth metals. It reacts very violently with water, chars\\npaper with which it is allowed to come in contact, and blackens in the\\nair, probably owing to the formation of a nitride. It fuses at 700° C.,\\nand is more volatile than barium.[104]\\n\\n    [103] See Sir T. E. THORPE: “On the Atomic Weight of Radium”\\n    (Bakerian Lecture for 1907.

(For an English\\n    translation of this paper see _The Chemical News_, vol. cii. p.\\n    175.)\\n\\n\\nThe Radioactivity of Radium.\\n\\n§ =89.= Radium salts give off three distinct sorts of rays, referred to\\nby the Greek letters α, β, γ. The α-rays have been shown to consist of\\nelectrically charged (positive) particles, with a mass approximately\\nequal to that of four hydrogen atoms; they are slightly deviated by a\\nmagnetic field, and do not possess great penetrative power. The β-rays\\nare similar to the kathode rays, and consist of (negative) electrons;\\nthey are strongly deviated by a magnetic field, in a direction opposite\\nto that in which the α-particles are deviated, and possess medium\\npenetrative power, passing for the most part through a thin sheet of\\nmetal. The γ-rays resemble X-rays; they possess great penetrative\\npower, and are not deviated by a magnetic field. The difference in the\\neffect of the magnetic field on these rays, and the difference in their\\npenetrative power, led to their detection and allows of their separate\\nexamination. Radium salts emit also an emanation, which tends to become\\noccluded in the solid salt, but can be conveniently liberated by\\ndissolving the salt in water, or by heating it. The emanation exhibits\\nthe characteristic properties of a gas, it obeys Boyle’s Law (_i.e._,\\nits volume varies inversely with its pressure), and it can be condensed\\nto a liquid at low temperatures; its density as determined by the\\ndiffusion method is about 100. Attempts to prepare chemical compounds of\\nthe emanation have failed, and in this respect it resembles the rare\\ngases of the atmosphere--helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon--whence\\nit is probable that its molecules are monatomic, so that a density of\\n100 would give its atomic weight as 200.[105] As can be seen from the\\ntable on pp. 106, 107, an atomic weight of about 220 corresponds to a\\nposition in the column containing the rare gases in the periodic system.\\nThat the emanation actually has an atomic weight of these dimensions was\\nconfirmed by further experiments carried out by the late Sir William\\nRamsay and Dr. R. W. Gray.[106] These chemists determined the density of\\nthe emanation by actually weighing minute quantities of known volume of\\nthe substance, sealed up in small capillary tubes, a specially\\nsensitive balance being employed. Values for the density varying from\\n108 to 113½, corresponding to values for the atomic weight varying from\\n216 to 227, were thereby obtained. Sir William Ramsay, therefore,\\nconsidered that there could no longer be any doubt that the emanation\\nwas one of the elements of the group of chemically inert gases. He\\nproposed to call it _Niton_, and, for reasons which we shall note later,\\nconsidered that in all probability it had an atomic weight of about\\n222½.\\n\\n    [105] This follows from Avogadro’s Hypothesis, see § 76.\\n\\n    [106] Sir WILLIAM RAMSAY and Dr. R. W. GRAY: “La densité de\\n    l’émanation du radium,” _Comptes Rendus hebdomadaires des Séances de\\n    l’Académie des Sciences_, vol. cvi. (1910), pp. 126 _et seq._\\n\\n\\nThe Disintegration of the Radium Atom.\\n\\n§ =90.= Radium salts possess another very remarkable property, namely,\\nthat of continuously emitting light and heat. It seemed, at first, that\\nhere was a startling contradiction to the law of the conservation of\\nenergy, but the whole mystery becomes comparatively clear in terms of\\nthe corpuscular or the electronic theory of matter. The radium-atom is a\\nsystem of a large number (see § 81) of corpuscles or electrons, and\\ncontains in virtue of their motion an enormous amount of energy. But it\\nis known from Chemistry that atomic systems (_i.e._, molecules) which\\ncontain very much energy are unstable and liable to explode. The same\\nlaw holds good on the more interior plane--the radium-atom is liable to,\\nand actually does, explode. And the result? Energy is set free, and\\nmanifests itself partly as heat and light. Some free electrons are shot\\noff (the β-rays), which, striking the undecomposed particles of salt,\\ngive rise to pulses in the ether (the γ-rays),[107] just as the kathode\\nparticles give rise to X-rays when they strike the walls of the vacuum\\ntube or a platinum disc placed in their path. The β- and γ-rays do not,\\nhowever, result immediately from the exploding radium-atoms, the initial\\nproducts being the emanation and one α-particle from each radium-atom\\ndestroyed.\\n\\n    [107] This view regarding the γ-rays is not, however, universally\\n    accepted, some scientists regarding them as consisting of a stream\\n    of particles moving with very high velocities.\\n\\n\\n“Induced Radioactivity.”\\n\\n§ =91.= Radium salts have the property of causing surrounding objects to\\nbecome temporally radioactive. This “induced radioactivity,” as it may\\nbe called, is found to be due to the emanation, which is itself\\nradioactive (it emits α-rays only), and is decomposed into minute traces\\nof solid radioactive deposits. By examining the rate of decay of the\\nactivity of the deposit, it has been found that it is undergoing a\\nseries of sub-atomic changes, the products being termed Radium A, B, C,\\n&c. It has been proved that all the β- and γ-rays emitted by radium\\nsalts are really due to certain of these secondary products. Radium F is\\nthought to be identical with Polonium (§ 87). Another product is also\\nobtained by these decompositions, with which we shall deal later (§ 94).\\n\\n\\nProperties of Uranium and Thorium.\\n\\n§ =92.= Uranium and thorium differ in one important respect from radium,\\ninasmuch as the first product of the decomposition of the uranium and\\nthorium atoms is in both cases solid. Sir William Crookes[108] was able\\nto separate from uranium salts by chemical means a small quantity of an\\nintensely radioactive substance, which he called Uranium X, the residual\\nuranium having lost most of its activity; and M. Becquerel, on\\nrepeating the experiment, found that the activity of the residual\\nuranium was slowly regained, whilst that of the uranium X decayed. This\\nis most simply explained by the theory that uranium first changes into\\nuranium X. It has been suggested that radium may be the final product of\\nthe breaking up of the uranium-atom; at any rate, it is quite certain\\nthat radium must be evolved in some way, as otherwise there would be\\nnone in existence--it would all have decomposed. This suggestion has\\nbeen experimentally confirmed, the growth of radium in large quantities\\nof a solution of purified uranyl nitrate having been observed. Uranium\\ngives no emanation. Thorium probably gives at least three solid\\nproducts--Meso-thorium, Radio-thorium, and Thorium X, the last of which\\nyields an emanation resembling that obtained from radium, but not\\nidentical with it.\\n\\n    [108] Sir WILLIAM CROOKES, F.R.S.: “Radio-activity of Uranium,”\\n    _Proceedings of the Royal Society of London_, vol. lxvi. (1900), pp.\\n    409 _et seq._\\n\\n\\nThe Radium Emanation.\\n\\n§ =93.= We must now more fully consider the radium emanation--a\\nsubstance with more astounding properties than even the radium compounds\\nthemselves. By distilling off the emanation from some radium bromide,\\nand measuring the quantities of heat given off by the emanation and the\\nradium salt respectively, Professors Rutherford and Barnes[109] proved\\nthat nearly three-fourths of the total amount of heat given out by a\\nradium salt comes from the minute quantity of emanation that it\\ncontains. The amount of energy liberated as heat during the decay of the\\nemanation is enormous; one cubic centimetre liberates about four\\nmillion times as much heat as is obtained by the combustion of an equal\\nvolume of hydrogen. Undoubtedly this must indicate some profound change,\\nand one may well ask, What is the ultimate product of the decomposition\\nof the emanation?\\n\\n    [109] E. RUTHERFORD, F.R.S., and H. T. BARNES, D.Sc.: “Heating\\n    Effect of the Radium Emanation,” _Philosophical Magazine_ [6], vol.\\n    vii. (1904), pp. 202 _et seq._\\n\\n\\nThe Production of Helium from Radium.\\n\\n§ =94.= It had been observed already that the radioactive minerals on\\nheating give off Helium--a gaseous element, characterised by a\\nparticular yellow line in its spectrum--and it seemed not unlikely that\\nhelium might be the ultimate decomposition product of the emanation. A\\nresearch to settle this point was undertaken by Sir William Ramsay and\\nMr. Soddy,[110] and a preliminary experiment having confirmed the above\\nspeculation, they carried out further very careful experiments. “The\\nmaximum amount of the emanation obtained from 50 milligrams of radium\\nbromide was conveyed by means of oxygen into a [U]-tube cooled in liquid\\nair, and the latter was then extracted by the pump.” The spectrum was\\nobserved; it “was apparently a new one, probably that of the emanation\\nitself. .\\xa0.\\xa0. After standing from July 17 to 21 the helium spectrum\\nappeared, and the characteristic lines were observed.” Sir William\\nRamsay performed a further experiment with a similar result, in which\\nthe radium salt had been first of all heated in a vacuum for some time,\\nproving that the helium obtained could not have been occluded in it;\\nthough the fact that the helium spectrum did not immediately appear, in\\nitself proves this point. Sir William Ramsay’s results were confirmed\\nby further careful experiments by Sir James Dewar and other chemists. It\\nwas suggested, therefore, that the α-particle consists of an\\nelectrically charged helium-atom, and not only is this view in agreement\\nwith the value of the mass of this particle as determined\\nexperimentally, but it has been completely demonstrated by Professor\\nRutherford and Mr. Royds. These chemists performed an experiment in\\nwhich the emanation from about one-seventh of a gramme of radium was\\nenclosed in a thin-walled tube, through the walls of which the\\nα-particles could pass, but which were impervious to gases. This tube\\nwas surrounded by an outer jacket, which was evacuated. After a time the\\npresence of helium in the space between the inner tube and the outer\\njacket was observed spectroscopically.[111] Now, the emanation-atom\\nresults from the radium-atom by the expulsion of one α-particle; and\\nsince this latter consists of an electrically charged helium-atom, it\\nfollows that the emanation must have an atomic weight of 226 - 4,\\n_i.e._, 222. This value is in agreement with Sir William Ramsay’s\\ndetermination of the density of the emanation. We may represent the\\ndegradation of the radium-atom, therefore, by the following scheme:--\\n\\n               α-particle (Helium-atom)\\n              /           4\\n  Radium-atom                          α-particle (Helium-atom)\\n      226     \\\\                       /           4\\n                Emanation (Niton-atom)\\n                         222          \\\\\\n                                       Radium-A, &c.\\n\\n    [110] Sir WILLIAM RAMSAY and FREDERICK SODDY: “Experiments in\\n    Radioactivity and the Production of Helium from Radium,”\\n    _Proceedings of the Royal Society of London_, vol. lxxii.

ROYDS, M.Sc.: “The Nature of the\\n    α-Particle from Radio-active Substances,” _Philosophical Magazine_\\n    [6], vol. xvii. (1909), pp. 281 _et seq._\\n\\n\\nNature of this Change.\\n\\n§ =95.= Here, then, for the first time in the history of Chemistry, we\\nhave the undoubted formation of one chemical element from another, for,\\nleaving out of the question the nature of the emanation, there can be no\\ndoubt that radium is a chemical element. This is a point which must be\\ninsisted upon, for it has been suggested that radium may be a compound\\nof helium with some unknown element; or, perhaps, a compound of helium\\nwith lead, since it has been shown that lead is probably one of the end\\nproducts of the decomposition of radium. The following considerations,\\nhowever, show this view to be altogether untenable: (i.) All attempts to\\nprepare compounds of helium with other elements have failed. (ii.)\\nRadium possesses all the properties of a chemical element; it has a\\ncharacteristic spectrum, and falls in that column in the Periodic Table\\nwith those elements which it resembles as to its chemical properties.\\n(iii.) The quantity of heat liberated on the decomposition of the\\nemanation is, as we have already indicated, out of all proportion to\\nthat obtained even in the most violent chemical reactions; and (iv.) one\\nvery important fact has been observed, namely, that the rate of decay of\\nthe emanation is unaffected by even extreme changes of temperature,\\nwhereas chemical actions are always affected in rate by changes of\\ntemperature. It will also be advisable, perhaps, to indicate some of the\\ndifferences between helium and the emanation. The latter is a heavy gas,\\ncondensable to a liquid by liquid air (recently it has been\\nsolidified[112]); whereas helium is the lightest of all known gases\\nwith the exception of hydrogen and has been liquefied only by the most\\npersistent effort.[113] The emanation, moreover, is radioactive, giving\\noff α-particles, whereas helium does not possess this property.\\n\\n    [112] By Ramsay. See _Proceedings of the Chemical Society_, vol.\\n    xxv. (1909), pp. 82 and 83.\\n\\n    [113] By Professor Onnes. See _Chemical News_, vol. xcviii. p. 37\\n    (July 24, 1908).\\n\\n\\nIs this Change a true Transmutation?\\n\\n§ =96.= It has been pointed out, however, that (in a sense) this change\\n(viz., of emanation into helium) is not quite what has been meant by the\\nexpression “transmutation of the elements”; for the reason that it is a\\n_spontaneous_ change; no effort of ours can bring it about or cause it\\nto cease.[114] But the fact of the change does go to prove that the\\nchemical elements are not the discrete units of matter that they were\\nsupposed to be. And since it appears that all matter is radioactive,\\nalthough (save in these exceptional cases) in a very slight degree,[115]\\nwe here have evidence of a process of evolution at work among the\\nchemical elements. The chemical elements are not permanent; they are all\\nundergoing change; and the common elements merely mark those points\\nwhere the rate of the evolutionary process is at its slowest. (See also\\n§§ 78 and 83.) Thus, the essential truth in the old alchemistic doctrine\\nof the growth of metals is vindicated, for the metals do grow in the\\nwomb of Nature, although the process may be far slower than appears to\\nhave been imagined by certain of the alchemists,[116] and although gold\\nmay not be the end product. As writes Professor Sir W. Tilden: “.\\xa0.\\xa0. It\\nappears that modern ideas as to the genesis of the elements, and hence\\nof all matter, stand in strong contrast with those which chiefly\\nprevailed among experimental philosophers from the time of Newton, and\\nseem to reflect in an altered form the speculative views of the\\nancients.” “.\\xa0.\\xa0. It seems probable,” he adds, “that the chemical\\nelements, and hence all material substances of which the earth, the sea,\\nthe air, and the host of heavenly bodies are all composed, resulted from\\na change, corresponding to condensation, in something of which we have\\nno direct and intimate knowledge. Some have imagined this primal essence\\nof all things to be identical with the ether of space. As yet we know\\nnothing with certainty, but it is thought that by means of the\\nspectroscope some stages of the operation may be seen in progress in the\\nnebulæ and stars. .\\xa0.\\xa0.”[117] We have next to consider whether there is\\nany experimental evidence showing it to be possible (using the\\nphraseology of the alchemists) for man to assist in Nature’s work.\\n\\n    [114] See Professor H. C. JONES: _The Electrical Nature of Matter\\n    and Radioactivity_ (1906), pp. 125-126.\\n\\n    [115] It has been definitely proved, for example, that the common\\n    element potassium is radioactive, though very feebly so (it emits\\n    β-rays). It is also interesting to note that many common substances\\n    emit corpuscles at high temperatures.\\n\\n    [116] Says Peter Bonus, however, “.\\xa0.\\xa0. we know that the generation\\n    of metals occupies thousands of years .\\xa0.\\xa0. in Nature’s workshop.\\n    .\\xa0.\\xa0.” (see _The New Pearl of Great Price_, Mr. A. E. Waite’s\\n    translation, p. 55), and certain others of the alchemists expressed\\n    a similar view.\\n\\n    [117] Sir WILLIAM A. TILDEN: _The Elements: Speculations as to their\\n    Nature and Origin_ (1910), pp. 108, 109, 133 and 134. With regard to\\n    Sir William Tilden’s remarks, it is very interesting to note that\\n    Swedenborg (who was born when Newton was between forty and fifty\\n    years old) not only differed from that great philosopher on those\\n    very points on which modern scientific philosophy is at variance\\n    with Newton, but, as is now recognised by scientific men,\\n    anticipated many modern discoveries and scientific theories. It\\n    would be a most interesting task to set forth the agreement existing\\n    between Swedenborg’s theories and the latest products of scientific\\n    thought concerning the nature of the physical universe. Such,\\n    however, would lie without the confines of the present work.\\n\\n\\nThe Production of Neon from Emanation.\\n\\n§ =97.= As we have already indicated above (§ 93), the radium emanation\\ncontains a vast store of potential energy, and it was with the idea of\\nutilising this energy for bringing about chemical changes that Sir\\nWilliam Ramsay[118] undertook a research on the chemical action of this\\nsubstance--a research with the most surprising and the most interesting\\nresults, for the energy contained within the radium emanation appeared\\nto behave like a veritable Philosopher’s Stone. The first experiments\\nwere carried out on distilled water. It had already been observed that\\nthe emanation decomposes water into its gaseous elements, oxygen and\\nhydrogen, and that the latter is always produced in excess. These\\nresults were confirmed and the presence of hydrogen peroxide was\\ndetected, explaining the formation of an excess of hydrogen; it was also\\nshown that the emanation brings about the reverse change to some extent,\\ncausing oxygen and hydrogen to unite with the production of water, until\\na position of equilibrium is attained. On examining spectroscopically\\nthe gas obtained by the action of the emanation on water, after the\\nremoval of the ordinary gases, a most surprising result was\\nobserved--the gas showed a brilliant spectrum of neon, accompanied with\\nsome faint helium lines. A more careful experiment was carried out later\\nby Sir William Ramsay and Mr. Cameron, in which a silica bulb was\\nemployed instead of glass. The spectrum of the residual gas after\\nremoving ordinary gases was successfully photographed, and a large\\nnumber of the neon lines identified; helium was also present. The\\npresence of neon could not be explained, in Ramsay’s opinion, by leakage\\nof air into the apparatus, as the percentage of neon in the air is not\\nsufficiently high, whereas this suggestion might be put forward in the\\ncase of argon. Moreover, the neon could not have come from the aluminium\\nof the electrodes (in which it might be thought to have been occluded),\\nas the sparking tube had been used and tested before the experiment was\\ncarried out. The authors conclude: “We must regard the transformation of\\nemanation into neon, in presence of water, as indisputably proved, and,\\nif a transmutation be defined as a transformation brought about at will,\\nby change of conditions, then _this is the first case of transmutation\\nof which conclusive evidence is put forward_.”[119] However, Professor\\nRutherford and Mr. Royds have been unable to confirm this result. They\\ndescribe[120] attempts to obtain neon by the action of emanation on\\nwater. Out of five experiments no neon was obtained, save in one case in\\nwhich a small air leak was discovered; and, since the authors find that\\nvery minute quantities of this gas are sufficient to give a clearly\\nvisible spectrum, they conclude that Ramsay’s positive results are due,\\nafter all, to leakage of air into the apparatus. But if this is the true\\nexplanation of Ramsay’s results, it is difficult to understand why, in\\nthe case of the experiment with a solution of a copper salt described\\nbelow, the presence of neon was not detected, for, if due to leakage,\\nthe proportions of the rare gases present should presumably have been\\nthe same in all the experiments. Further research seems necessary\\nconclusively to settle the question.\\n\\n    [118] Sir WILLIAM RAMSAY: “The Chemical Action of the Radium\\n    Emanation. Pt.

These “modern alchemists,”\\ntherefore, proceeded to investigate the action of radium emanation on\\nsolutions of copper and lead salts, and again apparently effected\\ntransmutations. They found on removing the copper from a solution of a\\ncopper-salt which had been subjected to the action of the emanation, and\\nspectroscopically examining the residue, that a considerable quantity of\\nsodium was present, together with traces of lithium; and the gas evolved\\nin the case of a solution of copper nitrate contained, along with much\\nnitric oxide and a little nitrogen, argon (which was detected\\nspectroscopically), but no helium. It certainly seemed like a dual\\ntransformation of copper into lithium and sodium, and emanation into\\nargon. They also observed that apparently carbon-dioxide is continually\\nevolved from an acid solution of thorium nitrate (see below, § 100). It\\nis worth while noticing that helium, neon and argon occur in the same\\ncolumn in the Periodic Table with emanation; lithium and sodium with\\ncopper, and carbon with thorium; in each case the elements produced\\nbeing of lighter atomic weight than those decomposed.[121] The authors\\nmake the following suggestions: “(1) That helium and the α-particle are\\nnot identical; (2) that helium results from the ‘degradation’ of the\\nlarge molecule of emanation by its bombardment with α-particles; (3)\\nthat this ‘degradation,’ when the emanation is alone or mixed with\\noxygen and hydrogen, results in the lowest member of the inactive\\nseries, namely, helium; (4) that if particles of greater mass than\\nhydrogen or oxygen are associated with the emanation, namely, liquid\\nwater, then the ‘degradation’ of the emanation is less complete, and\\nneon is produced; (5) that when molecules of still greater weight and\\ncomplexity are present, as is the case when the emanation is dissolved\\nin a solution of copper sulphate, the product of ‘degradation’ of the\\nemanation is argon. We are inclined to believe too [they say] that (6)\\nthe copper also is involved in this process of degradation, and is\\nreduced to the lowest term of its series, namely, lithium; and at the\\nsame time, inasmuch as the weight of the residue of alkali, produced\\nwhen copper nitrate is present, is double that obtained from the blank\\nexperiment, or from water alone, the supposition is not excluded that\\nthe chief product of the ‘degradation’ of copper is sodium.”[122]\\n\\n    [121] See pp. 106, 107.\\n\\n    [122] _Journal of the Chemical Society_, vol. xci. (1907), pp.\\n    1605-1606. More recent experiments, however, proved that the\\n    α-particle does consist of an electrically charged helium-atom, and\\n    this view was latterly accepted by Sir William Ramsay, so that the\\n    above suggestions must be modified in accordance therewith. (See §\\n    94.)\\n\\n\\nFurther Experiments on Radium and Copper.\\n\\n§ =99.= A little later Madame Curie and Mademoiselle Gleditsch[123]\\nrepeated Cameron and Ramsay’s experiments on copper salts, using,\\nhowever, platinum apparatus. They failed to detect lithium after the\\naction of the emanation, and think that Cameron and Ramsay’s results may\\nbe due to the glass vessels employed. Dr. Perman[124] has investigated\\nthe direct action of the emanation on copper and gold, and has failed to\\ndetect any trace of lithium. The transmutation of copper into lithium,\\ntherefore, must be regarded as unproved, but further research is\\nnecessary before any conclusive statements can be made on the subject.\\n\\n    [123] Madame CURIE and Mademoiselle GLEDITSCH: “Action de\\n    l’émanation du radium sur les solutions des sels de cuivre,”\\n    _Comptes Rendus hebdomadaires des Séances de l’Académie des\\n    Sciences_, vol. cxlvii.

The action of radium emanation on\\ncompounds (not containing carbon) of other members of the carbon group,\\nnamely, silicon, zirconium and lead, was then investigated; in the cases\\nof zirconium nitrate and hydro-fluosilicic acid, carbon-dioxide was\\nobtained; but in the case of lead chlorate the amount of carbon dioxide\\nwas quite insignificant. Curiously enough, the perchlorate of bismuth, a\\nmetal which belongs to the nitrogen group of elements, also yielded\\ncarbon-dioxide when acted on by emanation. Sir William Ramsay concludes\\nhis discussion of these experiments as follows: “Such are the facts. No\\none is better aware than I how insufficient the proof is. Many other\\nexperiments must be made before it can confidently be asserted that\\ncertain elements, when exposed to ‘concentrated energy,’ undergo\\ndegradation into carbon.” Some such confirmatory experiments were\\ncarried out by Sir William Ramsay and Mr. Francis L. Usher, and they\\nalso described an experiment with a compound of titanium. Their results\\nconfirm Sir William Ramsay’s former experiments. Carbon-dioxide was\\nobtained in appreciable quantities by the action of emanation on\\ncompounds of silicon, titanium, zirconium and thorium. In the case of\\nlead, the amount of carbon dioxide obtained was inappreciable.[126]\\n\\n    [125] Sir WILLIAM RAMSAY: “Elements and Electrons,” _Journal of the\\n    Chemical Society_, vol. xcv. (1909), pp. 624 _et seq._\\n\\n    [126] For a brief account in English of these later experiments see\\n    _The Chemical News_, vol. c. p. 209 (October 29, 1909).\\n\\n\\nThe Possibility of Making Gold.\\n\\n§ =101.= It does not seem unlikely that if it is possible to “degrade”\\nelements, it may be possible to build them up. It has been suggested\\nthat it might be possible to obtain, in this way, gold from silver,\\nsince these two elements occur in the same column in the Periodic Table;\\nbut the suggestion still awaits experimental confirmation. The question\\narises, What would be the result if gold could be cheaply produced? That\\ngold is a metal admirably adapted for many purposes, for which its\\nscarcity prevents its use, must be admitted. But the financial chaos\\nwhich would follow if it were to be cheaply obtained surpasses the\\nordinary imagination. It is a theme that ought to appeal to a novelist\\nof exceptional imaginative power. However, we need not fear these\\nresults, for not only is radium extremely rare, far dearer than gold,\\nand on account of its instability will never be obtained in large\\nquantities, but, judging from the above-described experiments, if,\\nindeed, the radium emanation is the true Philosopher’s Stone, the\\nquantity of gold that may be hoped for by its aid is extremely small.\\n\\n\\nThe Significance of “Allotropy.”\\n\\n§ =102.= A very suggestive argument for the transmutation of the metals\\nwas put forward by Professor Henry M. Howe, LL.D., in a paper entitled\\n“Allotropy or Transmutation?” read before the British Association\\n(Section B), Sheffield Meeting, 1910. Certain substances are known\\nwhich, although differing in their physical properties very markedly,\\nbehave chemically as if they were one and the same element, giving rise\\nto the same series of compounds. Such substances, of which we may\\nmention diamond, graphite and charcoal (_e.g._, lampblack)--all of which\\nare known chemically as “carbon”--or, to take another example, yellow\\nphosphorus (a yellow, waxy, highly inflammable solid) and red phosphorus\\n(a difficultly-inflammable, dark red substance, probably possessing a\\nminutely crystalline structure), are, moreover, convertible one into the\\nother.[127] It has been customary to refer to such substances as\\ndifferent forms or allotropic modifications of the same element, and not\\nto regard them as being different elements. As Professor Howe says, “If\\nafter defining ‘elements’ as substances hitherto indivisible, and\\ndifferent elements as those which differ in at least some one property,\\nand after asserting that the elements cannot be transmuted into each\\nother, we are confronted with the change from diamond into lampblack,\\nand with the facts, first, that each is clearly indivisible hitherto\\nand hence an element, and, second, that they differ in every property,\\nwe try to escape in a circle by saying that they are not different\\nelements because they do change into each other. In short, we limit the\\nname ‘element’ to indivisible substances which cannot be transmuted into\\neach other, and we define those which do transmute as _ipso facto_ one\\nelement, and then we say that the elements cannot be transmuted. Is not\\nthis very like saying that, if you call a calf’s tail a leg, then a calf\\nhas five legs? And if it is just to reply that calling a tail a leg does\\nnot make it a leg, is it not equally just to reply that calling two\\ntransmutable elements one element does not make them so?\\n\\n    [127] Diamond is transformed into graphite when heated by a powerful\\n    electric current between carbon poles, and both diamond and graphite\\n    can be indirectly converted into charcoal. The artificial production\\n    of the diamond, however, is a more difficult process; but the late\\n    Professor Moissan succeeded in effecting it, so far as very small\\n    diamonds are concerned, by dissolving charcoal in molten iron or\\n    silver and allowing it to crystallise from the solution under high\\n    pressure. Graphite was also obtained. Red phosphorus is produced\\n    from yellow phosphorus by heating the latter in absence of air. The\\n    temperature 240-250° C. is the most suitable; at higher temperatures\\n    the reverse change sets in, red phosphorus being converted into\\n    yellow phosphorus.\\n\\n“Is it philosophical to point to the fact that two such transmutable\\nelements yield but a single line of derivatives as proof that they are\\none element? Is not this rather proof of the readiness, indeed\\nirresistibleness, of their transmutation? Does not this simply mean that\\nthe derivativeless element, whenever it enters into combination,\\ninevitably transmutes into its mate which has derivatives?”[128]\\n\\n    [128] Professor HENRY M. HOWE, LL.D.: “Allotropy or Transmutation.”\\n    (See _The Chemical News_, vol. cii. pp. 153 and 154, September 23,\\n    1910.)\\n\\nAccording to the atomic theory the differences between what are termed\\n“allotropic modifications” are generally ascribed to differences in the\\nnumber and arrangement of the atoms constituting the molecules of such\\n“modifications,” and not to any differences in the atoms themselves. But\\nwe cannot argue that two such “allotropic modifications” or elements\\nwhich are transmutable into one another are one and the same element,\\nbecause they possess the same atomic weight, and different elements are\\ndistinguished by different atomic weights; for the reason that, in the\\ndetermination of atomic weights, derivatives of such bodies are\\nemployed; hence, the value obtained is the atomic weight of the element\\nwhich forms derivatives, from which that of its derivativeless mate may\\ndiffer considerably for all we know to the contrary, if we do, indeed,\\nregard the atomic weights of the elements as having any meaning beyond\\nexpressing the inertia-ratios in which they combine one with another.\\n\\nIf we wish to distinguish between two such “allotropic modifications”\\napart from any theoretical views concerning the nature and constitution\\nof matter, we can say that such “modifications” are different because\\nequal weights of them contain, or are equivalent to, different\\nquantities of energy,[129] since the change of one “form” to another\\ntakes place only with the evolution or absorption (as the case may be)\\nof heat.[130] But, according to modern views regarding the nature of\\nmatter, this is the sole fundamental difference between two different\\nelements--such are different because equal weights of them contain or\\nare equivalent to different quantities of energy. The so-called\\n“allotropic modifications of an element,” therefore, are just as much\\ndifferent elements as any other different elements, and the change from\\none “modification” to another is a true transmutation of the elements;\\nthe only distinction being that what are called “allotropic\\nmodifications of the same element” differ only slightly in respect of\\nthe energy they contain, and hence are comparatively easy to convert one\\ninto the other, whereas different elements (so called) differ very\\ngreatly from one another in this respect, whence it is to be concluded\\nthat the transmutation of one such element into another will only be\\nattained by the utilisation of energy in a very highly concentrated\\nform, such as is evolved simultaneously with the spontaneous\\ndecomposition of the radium emanation.\\n\\n    [129] For a defence of the view that chemical substances may be\\n    regarded as energy-complexes, and that this view is equally as valid\\n    as the older notion of a chemical substance as an inertia-complex,\\n    _i.e._, as something made up entirely of different units or atoms\\n    each characterised by the possession of a definite and constant\\n    weight at a fixed point on the earth’s surface, see an article by\\n    the present writer, entitled “The Claims of Thermochemistry,”\\n    _Knowledge and Scientific News_, vol. vii. (New Series), pp. 227 _et\\n    seq._ (July, 1910).\\n\\n    [130] In some cases the heat change accompanying the transformation\\n    of an element into an “allotropic modification” can be measured\\n    directly. More frequently, however, it is calculated as the\\n    difference between the quantities of heat obtained when the two\\n    “forms” are converted into one and the same compound.\\n\\n\\nConclusion.\\n\\n§ =103.= We have shown that modern science indicates the essential truth\\nof alchemistic doctrine, and our task is ended. Writing in 1904, Sir\\nWilliam Ramsay said: “If these hypotheses [concerning the possibility of\\ncausing the atoms of ordinary elements to absorb energy] are just, then\\nthe transmutations of the elements no longer appears an idle dream. The\\nphilosopher’s stone will have been discovered, and it is not beyond the\\nbounds of possibility that it may lead to that other goal of the\\nphilosophers of the dark ages--the _elixir vitæ_. For the action of\\nliving cells is also dependent on the nature and direction of the energy\\nwhich they contain; and who can say that it will be impossible to\\ncontrol their action, when the means of imparting and controlling energy\\nshall have been investigated?”[131] Whatever may be the final verdict\\nconcerning his own experiments, those of Sir Ernest Rutherford, referred\\nto in the Preface to the present edition, demonstrate the fact of\\ntransmutation; and it is worth noticing how many of the alchemists’\\nobscure descriptions of their Magistery well apply to that marvellous\\nsomething which we call Energy, the true “First Matter” of the Universe.\\nAnd of the other problem, the _Elixir Vitæ_, who knows?\\n\\n    [131] Sir WILLIAM RAMSAY: “Radium and its Products,” _Harper’s\\n    Magazine_ (December 1904), vol. xlix.

noted alchemists by h stanley redgrove b sc lond f c s author of on the calculation of thermo chemical constants matter spirit and the cosmos etc with full page illustrations second and revised edition london william rider son ltd paternoster row e c first published second edition preface to the second edition it is exceedingly gratifying to me that a second edition of this book should be called for but still more welcome is the change in the attitude of the educated world towards the old time alchemists and their theories which has taken place during the past few years the theory of the origin of alchemy put forward in chapter i has led to considerable discussion but whilst this theory has met with general acceptance some of its earlier critics took it as implying far more than is actually the case as a result of further research my conviction of its truth has become more fully confirmed and in my recent work entitled bygone beliefs rider under the title of the quest of the philosopher s stone i have found it possible to adduce further evidence in this connection at the same time whilst i became increasingly convinced that the main alchemistic hypotheses were drawn from the domain of mystical theology and applied to physics and chemistry by way of analogy it also became evident to me that the crude physiology of bygone ages and remnants of the old phallic faith formed a further and subsidiary source of alchemistic theory i have barely if at all touched on this matter in the present work the reader who is interested will find it dealt with in some detail in the phallic element in alchemical doctrine in my bygone beliefs in view of recent research in the domain of radioactivity and the consequent advance in knowledge that has resulted since this book was first published i have carefully considered the advisability of rewriting the whole of the last chapter but came to the conclusion that the time for this was not yet ripe and that apart from a few minor emendations the chapter had better remain very much as it originally stood my reason for this course was that whilst considerably more is known to day than was the case in concerning the very complex transmutations undergone spontaneously by the radioactive elements knowledge helping further to elucidate the problem of the constitution of the so called elements of the chemist the problem really cognate to my subject namely that of effecting a transmutation of one element into another at will remains in almost the same state of indeterminateness as in in sir william ramsay thought he had obtained evidence for the transmutation of hydrogen into helium by the action of the electric discharge and professors collie and patterson thought they had obtained evidence of the transmutation of hydrogen into neon by similar means but these observations as well as sir william ramsay s earlier transmutational experiments failed to be satisfactorily confirmed and since the death of the latter little if anything appears to have been done to settle the questions raised by his experiments reference must however be made to a very interesting investigation by sir ernest rutherford on the collision of particles with light atoms from which it appears certain that when bombarded with the swiftly moving particles given off by radium c the atoms of nitrogen may be disintegrated one of the products being hydrogen the other product is possibly helium though this has not been proved in view of rutherford s results a further repetition of ramsay s experiments would certainly appear to be advisable see his the presence of helium in the gas from the interior of an x ray bulb journal of the chemical society vol ciii pp et seq see their the presence of neon in hydrogen after the passage of the electric discharge through the latter at low pressures ibid pp et seq and the production of neon and helium by the electric discharge proceedings of the royal society a vol xci pp et seq see especially the report of negative experiments by mr a c g egerton published in proceedings of the royal society a vol xci pp et seq see the philosophical magazine for june th series vol xxxvii pp or perhaps an isotope of helium see below as concerns the spontaneous transmutations undergone by the radioactive elements the facts appear to indicate or at least can be brought into some sort of order by supposing the atom to consist of a central nucleus and an outer shell as suggested by sir ernest rutherford the nucleus may be compared to the sun of a solar system it is excessively small but in it the mass of the atom is almost entirely concentrated it is positively charged the charge being neutralised by that of the free electrons which revolve like planets about it and which by their orbits account for the volume of the atom the atomic weight of the element depends upon the central sun but the chemical properties of the element are determined by the number of electrons in the shell this number is the same as that representing the position of the element in the periodic system radioactive change originates in the atomic nucleus the expulsion of an particle therefrom decreases the atomic weight by units necessitates since the particle carries two positive charges the removal of two electrons from the shell in order to maintain electrical neutrality and hence changes the chemical nature of the body transmuting the element into one occupying a position two places to the left in the periodic system for example the change of radium into niton but radioactivity sometimes results in the expulsion of a particle from the nucleus this results in the addition of an electron to the shell and hence changes the chemical character of the element transmuting it into one occupying a position one place to the right in the periodic system but without altering its atomic weight consequently the expulsion of one and two particles from the nucleus whilst decreasing the atomic weight of the element by leaves the number of electrons in the shell and thus the chemical properties of the element unaltered these remarkable conclusions are amply borne out by the facts and the discovery of elements called isobares having the same atomic weight but different chemical properties and of those called isotopes having identical chemical characters but different atomic weights must be regarded as one of the most significant and important discoveries of recent years some further reference to this theory will be found in and the reader who wishes to follow the matter further should consult the fourth edition of professor frederick soddy s the interpretation of radium and the two chapters on the subject in his science and life one of which is a popular exposition and the other a more technical one these advances in knowledge all point to the possibility of effecting transmutations at will but so far attempts to achieve this as i have already indicated cannot be regarded as altogether satisfactory several methods of making gold or rather elements chemically identical with gold once the method of controlling radioactive change is discovered as assuredly it will be are suggested by sir ernest rutherford s theory of the nuclear atom thus the expulsion of two particles from bismuth or one from thallium would yield the required result or lead could be converted into mercury by the expulsion of one particle and this into thallium by the expulsion of one particle yielding gold by the further expulsion of an particle but as professor soddy remarks in his science and life just referred to if man ever achieves this further control over nature it is quite certain that the last thing he would want to do would be to turn lead or mercury into gold for the sake of gold the energy that would be liberated if the control of these sub atomic processes were as possible as is the control of ordinary chemical changes such as combustion would far exceed in importance and value the gold rather it would pay to transmute gold into silver or some base metal in of the book i suggest that the question of the effect on the world of finance of the discovery of an inexpensive method of transmuting base metal into gold on a large scale is one that should appeal to a novelist specially gifted with imagination since the words were first written a work has appeared in which something approximating to what was suggested has been attempted and very admirably achieved my reference is to mr h g wells s novel the world set free published in in conclusion i should like to thank the very many reviewers who found so many good things to say concerning the first edition of this book for kind assistance in reading the proofs of this edition my best thanks are due also and are hereby tendered to my wife and my good friend gerald druce esq m sc h s r camden road london n w october preface the number of books in the english language dealing with the interesting subject of alchemy is not sufficiently great to render an apology necessary for adding thereto indeed at the present time there is an actual need for a further contribution on this subject the time is gone when it was regarded as perfectly legitimate to point to alchemy as an instance of the aberrations of the human mind recent experimental research has brought about profound modifications in the scientific notions regarding the chemical elements and indeed in the scientific concept of the physical universe itself and a certain resemblance can be traced between these later views and the theories of bygone alchemy the spontaneous change of one element into another has been witnessed and the recent work of sir william ramsay suggests the possibility of realising the old alchemistic dream the transmutation of the base metals into gold the basic idea permeating all the alchemistic theories appears to have been this all the metals and indeed all forms of matter are one in origin and are produced by an evolutionary process the soul of them all is one and the same it is only the soul that is permanent the body or outward form i e the mode of manifestation of the soul is transitory and one form may be transmuted into another the similarity indeed it might be said the identity between this view and the modern etheric theory of matter is at once apparent the old alchemists reached the above conclusion by a theoretical method and attempted to demonstrate the validity of their theory by means of experiment in which it appears they failed modern science adopting the reverse process for a time lost hold of the idea of the unity of the physical universe to gain it once again by the experimental method it was in the elaboration of this grand fundamental idea that alchemy failed if i were asked to contrast alchemy with the chemical and physical science of the nineteenth century i would say that whereas the latter abounded in a wealth of much accurate detail and much relative truth it lacked philosophical depth and insight whilst alchemy deficient in such accurate detail was characterised by a greater degree of philosophical depth and insight for the alchemists did grasp the fundamental truth of the cosmos although they distorted it and made it appear grotesque the alchemists cast their theories in a mould entirely fantastic even ridiculous they drew unwarrantable analogies and hence their views cannot be accepted in these days of modern science but if we cannot approve of their theories in toto we can nevertheless appreciate the fundamental ideas at the root of them and it is primarily with the object of pointing out this similarity between these ancient ideas regarding the physical universe and the latest products of scientific thought that this book has been written it is a regrettable fact that the majority of works dealing with the subject of alchemy take a one sided point of view the chemists generally take a purely physical view of the subject and instead of trying to understand its mystical language often i do not say always prefer to label it nonsense and the alchemist a fool on the other hand the mystics in many cases take a purely transcendental view of the subject forgetting the fact that the alchemists were for the most part concerned with operations of a physical nature for a proper understanding of alchemy as i hope to make plain in the first chapter of this work a synthesis of both points of view is essential and since these two aspects are so intimately and essentially connected with one another this is necessary even when as in the following work one is concerned primarily with the physical rather than the purely mystical aspect of the subject now the author of this book may lay claim to being a humble student of both chemistry and what may be generalised under the terms mysticism and transcendentalism and he hopes that this perhaps rather unusual combination of studies has enabled him to take a broad minded view of the theories of the alchemists and to adopt a sympathetic attitude towards them with regard to the illustrations the author must

generally understood to have been that art whose end was the transmutation of the so called base metals into gold by means of an ill defined something called the philosopher s stone but even from a purely physical standpoint this is a somewhat superficial view alchemy was both a philosophy and an experimental science and the transmutation of the metals was its end only in that this would give the final proof of the alchemistic hypotheses in other words alchemy considered from the physical standpoint was the attempt to demonstrate experimentally on the material plane the validity of a certain philosophical view of the cosmos we see the genuine scientific spirit in the saying of one of the alchemists would to god all men might become adepts in our art for then gold the great idol of mankind would lose its value and we should prize it only for its scientific teaching unfortunately however not many alchemists came up to this ideal and for the majority of them alchemy did mean merely the possibility of making gold cheaply and gaining untold wealth eiren us philalethes an open entrance to the closed palace of the king see the hermetic museum restored and enlarged edited by a e waite vol ii p the transcendental theory of alchemy by some mystics however the opinion has been expressed that alchemy was not a physical art or science at all that in no sense was its object the manufacture of material gold and that its processes were not carried out on the physical plane according to this transcendental theory alchemy was concerned with man s soul its object was the perfection not of material substances but of man in a spiritual sense those who hold this view identify alchemy with or at least regard it as a branch of mysticism from which it is supposed to differ merely by the employment of a special language and they hold that the writings of the alchemists must not be understood literally as dealing with chemical operations with furnaces retorts alembics pelicans and the like with salt sulphur mercury gold and other material substances but must be understood as grand allegories dealing with spiritual truths according to this view the figure of the transmutation of the base metals into gold symbolised the salvation of man the transmutation of his soul into spiritual gold which was to be obtained by the elimination of evil and the development of good by the grace of god and the realisation of which salvation or spiritual transmutation may be described as the new birth or that condition of being known as union with the divine it would follow of course if this theory were true that the genuine alchemists were pure mystics and hence that the development of chemical science was not due to their labours but to pseudo alchemists who so far misunderstood their writings as to have interpreted them in a literal sense failure of the transcendental theory this theory however has been effectively disposed of by mr arthur edward waite who points to the lives of the alchemists themselves in refutation of it for their lives indisputably prove that the alchemists were occupied with chemical operations on the physical plane and that for whatever motive they toiled to discover a method for transmuting the commoner metals into actual material gold as paracelsus himself says of the true spagyric physicians who were the alchemists of his period these do not give themselves up to ease and idleness but they devote themselves diligently to their labours sweating whole nights over fiery furnaces these do not kill the time with empty talk but find their delight in their laboratory the writings of the alchemists contain mixed however with much that from the physical standpoint appears merely fantastic accurate accounts of many chemical processes and discoveries which cannot be explained away by any method of transcendental interpretation there is not the slightest doubt that chemistry owes its origin to the direct labours of the alchemists themselves and not to any who misread their writings paracelsus concerning the nature of things see the hermetic and alchemical writings of paracelsus edited by a e waite vol i p the qualifications of the adept at the same time it is quite evident that there is a considerable element of mysticism in the alchemistic doctrines this has always been recognised but as a general rule those who have approached the subject from the scientific point of view have considered this mystical element as of little or no importance however there are certain curious facts which are not satisfactorily explained by a purely physical theory of alchemy and in our opinion the recognition of the importance of this mystical element and of the true relation which existed between alchemy and mysticism is essential for the right understanding of the subject we may notice in the first place that the alchemists always speak of their art as a divine gift the highest secrets of which are not to be learnt from any books on the subject and they invariably teach that the right mental attitude with regard to god is the first step necessary for the achievement of the magnum opus as says one alchemist in the first place let every devout and god fearing chemist and student of this art consider that this arcanum should be regarded not only as a truly great but as a most holy art seeing that it typifies and shadows out the highest heavenly good therefore if any man desire to reach this great and unspeakable mystery he must remember that it is obtained not by the might of man but by the grace of god and that not our will or desire but only the mercy of the most high can bestow it upon us for this reason you must first of all cleanse your heart lift it up to him alone and ask of him this gift in true earnest and undoubting prayer he alone can give and bestow it and basil valentine first there should be the invocation of god flowing from the depth of a pure and sincere heart and a conscience which should be free from all ambition hypocrisy and vice as also from all cognate faults such as arrogance boldness pride luxury worldly vanity oppression of the poor and similar iniquities which should all be rooted up out of the heart that when a man appears before the throne of grace to regain the health of his body he may come with a conscience weeded of all tares and be changed into a pure temple of god cleansed of all that defiles the sophic hydrolith or water stone of the wise see the hermetic museum vol i p the triumphal chariot of antimony mr a e waite s translation p see alchemistic language in the second place we must notice the nature of alchemistic language as we have hinted above and as is at once apparent on opening any alchemistic book the language of alchemy is very highly mystical and there is much that is perfectly unintelligible in a physical sense indeed the alchemists habitually apologise for their vagueness on the plea that such mighty secrets may not be made more fully manifest it is true of course that in the days of alchemy s degeneracy a good deal of pseudo mystical nonsense was written by the many impostors then abounding but the mystical style of language is by no means confined to the later alchemistic writings it is also true that the alchemists no doubt desired to shield their secrets from vulgar and profane eyes and hence would necessarily adopt a symbolic language but it is past belief that the language of the alchemist was due to some arbitrary plan whatever it is to us it was very real to him moreover this argument cuts both ways for those also who take a transcendental view of alchemy regard its language as symbolical although after a different manner it is also to say the least curious as mr a e waite points out that this mystical element should be found in the writings of the earlier alchemists whose manuscripts were not written for publication and therefore ran no risk of informing the vulgar of the precious secrets of alchemy on the other hand the transcendental method of translation does often succeed in making sense out of what is otherwise unintelligible in the writings of the alchemists the above mentioned writer remarks on this point without in any way pretending to assert that this hypothesis reduces the literary chaos of the philosophers into a regular order it may be affirmed that it materially elucidates their writings and that it is wonderful how contradictions absurdities and difficulties seem to dissolve wherever it is applied arthur edward waite the occult sciences p the alchemists love of symbolism is also conspicuously displayed in the curious designs with which certain of their books are embellished we are not here referring to the illustrations of actual apparatus employed in carrying out the various operations of physical alchemy which are not infrequently found in the works of those alchemists who at the same time were practical chemists glauber for example but to pictures whose meaning plainly lies not upon the surface and whose import is clearly symbolical whether their symbolism has reference to physical or to spiritual processes examples of such symbolic illustrations many of which are highly fantastic will be found in plates and we shall refer to them again in the course of the present and following chapters alchemists of a mystical type we must also notice that although there cannot be the slightest doubt that the great majority of alchemists were engaged in problems and experiments of a physical nature yet there were a few men included within the alchemistic ranks who were entirely or almost entirely concerned with problems of a spiritual nature thomas vaughan for example and jacob boehme who boldly employed the language of alchemy in the elaboration of his system of mystical philosophy and particularly must we notice as mr a e waite has also indicated the significant fact that the western alchemists make unanimous appeal to hermes trismegistos as the greatest authority on the art of alchemy whose alleged writings are of an undoubtedly mystical character see it is clear that in spite of its apparently physical nature alchemy must have been in some way closely connected with mysticism the meaning of alchemy if we are ever to understand the meaning of alchemy aright we must look at the subject from the alchemistic point of view in modern times there has come about a divorce between religion and science in men s minds though more recently a unifying tendency has set in but it was otherwise with the alchemists their religion and their science were closely united we have said that alchemy was the attempt to demonstrate experimentally on the material plane the validity of a certain philosophical view of the cosmos now this philosophical view of the cosmos was mysticism alchemy had its origin in the attempt to apply in a certain manner the principles of mysticism to the things of the physical plane and was therefore of a dual nature on the one hand spiritual and religious on the other physical and material as the anonymous author of lives of alchemystical philosophers remarks the universal chemistry by which the science of alchemy opens the knowledge of all nature being founded on first principles forms analogy with whatever knowledge is founded on the same first principles saint john describes the redemption or the new creation of the fallen soul on the same first principles until the consummation of the work in which the divine tincture transmutes the base metal of the soul into a perfection that will pass the fire of eternity that is to say alchemy and the mystical regeneration of man in this writer s opinion are analogous processes on different planes of being because they are founded on the same first principles f b lives of alchemystical philosophers preface p opinions of other writers we shall here quote the opinions of two modern writers as to the significance of alchemy one a mystic the other a man of science says mr a e waite if the authors of the suggestive inquiry and of remarks on alchemy and the alchemists two books putting forward the transcendental theory had considered the lives of the symbolists as well as the nature of the symbols their views would have been very much modified they would have found that the true method of hermetic interpretation lies in a middle course but the errors which originated with merely typographical investigations were intensified by a consideration of the great alchemical theorem which par excellence is one of universal development which acknowledges that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection they the generality of alchemists applied their theory only to the development of metallic substances from a lower to a higher order but we see by their writings that the grand hierophants of oriental and western alchemy alike were continually haunted by brief and imperfect glimpses of glorious possibilities for man if the evolution of his nature were accomplished along the lines of their theory mr m m pattison muir m a says alchemy aimed at giving experimental proof of a certain theory of the whole system of nature including humanity the practical culmination of the alchemical quest presented a threefold aspect the alchemists sought the stone of wisdom for by gaining that they gained the control of wealth they sought the universal panacea for that would give them the power of enjoying wealth and life they sought the soul of the world for thereby they could hold communion with spiritual existences and enjoy the fruition of spiritual life the object of their search was to satisfy their material needs their intellectual capacities and their spiritual yearnings the alchemists of the nobler sort always made the first of these objects subsidiary to the other two arthur edward waite lives of alchemystical philosophers pp as says another writer of the mystical school of thought if we look upon the subject of alchymy from the point which affords the widest view it may be said that alchymy has two aspects the simply material and the religious the dogma that alchymy was only a form of chemistry is untenable by any one who has read the works of its chief professors the doctrine that alchymy was religion only and that its chemical references were all blinds is equally untenable in the face of history which shows that many of its most noted professors were men who had made important discoveries in the domain of common chemistry and were in no way notable as teachers either of ethics or religion sapere aude the science of alchymy spiritual and material pp and m m pattison muir m a the story of alchemy and the beginnings of chemistry pp and the basic idea of alchemy the famous axiom beloved by every alchemist what is above is as that which is below and what is below is as that which is above although of questionable origin tersely expresses the basic idea of alchemy the alchemists postulated and believed in a very real sense in the essential unity of the cosmos hence they held that there is a correspondence or analogy existing between things spiritual and things physical the same laws operating in each realm as writes sendivogius the sages have been taught of god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its celestial archetype and that god has created it in imitation of the spiritual and invisible universe in order that men might be the better enabled to comprehend his heavenly teaching and the wonders of his absolute and ineffable power and wisdom thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals he jealously conceals it from the sinner and the scornful lest the mysteries of heaven should be laid bare to the vulgar gaze michael sendivogius the new chemical light pt ii concerning sulphur the hermetic museum vol ii p the alchemists held that the metals are one in essence and spring from the same seed in the womb of nature but are not all equally matured and perfect gold being the highest product of nature s powers in gold the alchemist saw a picture of the regenerate man resplendent with spiritual beauty overcoming all temptations and proof against evil whilst he regarded lead the basest of the metals as typical of the sinful and unregenerate man stamped with the hideousness of sin and easily overcome by temptation and evil for whilst gold withstood the action of fire and all known corrosive liquids save aqua regia alone lead was most easily acted upon we are told that the philosopher s stone which would bring about the desired grand transmutation is of a species with gold itself and purer than the purest understood in the mystical sense this means that the regeneration of man can be effected only by goodness itself in terms of christian theology by the power of the spirit of christ the philosopher s stone was regarded as symbolical of christ jesus and in this sense we can understand the otherwise incredible powers attributed to it the law of analogy with the theories of physical alchemy we shall deal at length in the following chapter but enough has been said to indicate the analogy existing according to the alchemistic view between the problem of the perfection of the metals i e the transmutation of the base metals into gold and the perfection or transfiguration of spiritual man and it might also be added between these problems and that of the perfection of man considered physiologically to the alchemistic philosopher these three problems were one the same problem on different planes of being and the solution was likewise one he who held the key to one problem held the key to all three provided he understood the analogy between matter and spirit the point is not be it noted whether these problems are in reality one and the same the main doctrine of analogy which is indeed an essential element in all true mystical philosophy will we suppose meet with general consent but it will be contended and rightly we think that the analogies drawn by the alchemists are fantastic and by no means always correct though possibly there may be more truth in them than appears at first sight the point is not that these analogies are correct but that they were regarded as such by all true alchemists says the author of the sophic hydrolith the practice of this art enables us to understand not merely the marvels of nature but the nature of god himself in all its unspeakable glory it shadows forth in a wonderful manner all the articles of the christian faith and the reason why man must pass through much tribulation and anguish and fall a prey to death before he can rise again to a new life a considerable portion of this curious alchemistic work is taken up in expounding the analogy believed to exist between the philosopher s stone and the stone which the builders rejected christ jesus and the writer concludes thus i have briefly and simply set forth to you the perfect analogy which exists between our earthly and chemical and the true and heavenly stone jesus christ whereby we may attain unto certain beatitude and perfection not only in earthly but also in eternal life and likewise says peter bonus i am firmly persuaded that any unbeliever who got truly to know this art would straightway confess the truth of our blessed religion and believe in the trinity and in our lord jesus christ the sophic hydrolith or water stone of the wise see the hermetic museum vol i p ibid p peter bonus the new pearl of great price mr a e waite s translation p the dual nature of alchemy for the most part the alchemists were chiefly engaged with the carrying out of the alchemistic theory on the physical plane i e with the attempt to transmute the base metals into the noble ones some for the love of knowledge but alas the vast majority for the love of mere wealth but all who were worthy of the title of alchemist realised at times more or less dimly the possibility of the application of the same methods to man and the glorious result of the transmutation of man s soul into spiritual gold there were a few who had a clearer vision of this ideal those who devoted their activities entirely or almost so to the attainment of this highest goal of alchemistic philosophy and concerned themselves little if at all with the analogous problem on the physical plane the theory that alchemy originated in the attempt to demonstrate the applicability of the principles of mysticism to the things of the physical realm brings into harmony the physical and transcendental theories of alchemy and the various conflicting facts advanced in favour of each it explains the existence of the above mentioned two very different types of alchemists it explains the appeal to the works attributed to hermes and the presence in the writings of the alchemists of much that is clearly mystical and finally it is in agreement with such statements as we have quoted above from the sophic hydrolith and elsewhere and the general religious tone of the alchemistic writings illustration plate symbolical illustration representing the trinity of body soul and spirit to face page body soul and spirit in accordance with our primary object as stated in the preface we shall confine our attention mainly to the physical aspect of alchemy but in order to understand its theories it appears to us to be essential to realise the fact that alchemy was an attempted application of the principles of mysticism to the things of the physical world the supposed analogy between man and the metals sheds light on what otherwise would be very difficult to understand it helps to make plain why the alchemists attributed moral qualities to the metals some are called imperfect base others are said to be perfect noble and especially does it help to explain the alchemistic notions regarding the nature of the metals the alchemists believed that the metals were constructed after the manner of man into whose constitution three factors were regarded as entering body soul and spirit as regards man mystical philosophers generally use these terms as follows body is the outward manifestation and form soul is the inward individual spirit and spirit is the universal soul in all men and likewise according to the alchemists in the metals there is the body or outward form and properties metalline soul or spirit and finally the all pervading essence of all metals as writes the author of the exceedingly curious tract entitled the book of lambspring be warned and understand truly that two fishes are swimming in our sea illustrating his remark by the symbolical picture reproduced in plate and adding in elucidation thereof the sea is the body the two fishes are soul and spirit the alchemists however were not always consistent in their use of the term spirit sometimes indeed frequently they employed it to denote merely the more volatile portions of a chemical substance at other times it had a more interior significance which in virtue of man s self consciousness is by the grace of god immortal see the work of natural and supernatural things attributed to basil valentine for a description of the spirits of the metals in particular the book of lambspring translated by nicholas barnaud delphinas see the hermetic museum vol i p this work contains many other fantastic alchemistic symbolical pictures amongst the most curious series in alchemistic literature alchemy mysticism and modern science we notice the great difference between the alchemistic theory and the views regarding the constitution of matter which have dominated chemistry since the time of dalton but at the present time dalton s theory of the chemical elements is undergoing a profound modification we do not imply that modern science is going back to any such fantastic ideas as were held by the alchemists but we are struck with the remarkable similarity between this alchemistic theory of a soul of all metals a one primal element and modern views regarding the ether of space in its attempt to demonstrate the applicability of the fundamental principles of mysticism to the things of the physical realm alchemy apparently failed and ended its days in fraud it appears however that this true aim of alchemistic art particularly the demonstration of the validity of the theory that all the various forms of matter are produced by an evolutionary process from some one primal element or quintessence is being realised by recent researches in the domain of physical and chemical science chapter ii the theory of physical alchemy supposed proofs of transmutation it must be borne in mind when reviewing the theories of the alchemists that there were a number of phenomena known at the time the superficial examination of which would naturally engender a belief that the transmutation of the metals was a common occurrence for example the deposition of copper on iron when immersed in a solution of a copper salt e g blue vitriol was naturally concluded to be a transmutation of iron into copper although had the alchemists examined the residual liquid they would have found that the two metals had merely exchanged places and the fact that white and yellow alloys of copper with arsenic and other substances could be produced pointed to the possibility of transmuting copper into silver and gold it was also known that if water and this is true of distilled water which does not contain solid matter in solution was boiled for some time in a glass flask some solid earthy matter was produced and if water could be transmuted into earth surely one metal could be converted into another on account of these and like phenomena the alchemists regarded the transmutation of the metals as an experimentally proved fact even if they are to be blamed for their superficial observation of such phenomena yet nevertheless their labours marked a distinct advance upon the purely speculative and theoretical methods of the philosophers preceding them whatever their faults the alchemists were the forerunners of modern experimental science cf the golden tract concerning the stone of the philosophers the hermetic museum vol i p lavoisier eighteenth century proved this apparent transmutation to be due to the action of the water on the glass vessel containing it the alchemistic elements the alchemists regarded the metals as composite and granting this then the possibility of transmutation is only a logical conclusion in order to understand the theory of the elements held by them we must rid ourselves of any idea that it bears any close resemblance to dalton s theory of the chemical elements this is clear from what has been said in the preceding chapter now it is a fact of simple observation that many otherwise different bodies manifest some property in common as for instance combustibility properties such as these were regarded as being due to some principle or element common to all bodies exhibiting such properties thus combustibility was thought to be due to some elementary principle of combustion the sulphur of the alchemists and the phlogiston of a later period this is a view which priori appears to be not unlikely but it is now known that although there are relations existing between the properties of bodies and their constituent chemical elements and also it should be noted the relative arrangement of the particles of these elements it is the less obvious properties which enable chemists to determine the constitution of bodies and the connection is very far from being of the simple nature imagined by the alchemists aristotle s views regarding the elements for the origin of the alchemistic theory of the elements it is necessary to go back to the philosophers preceding the alchemists and it is not improbable that they derived it from some still older source it was taught by empedocles of agrigent b c circa who considered that there were four elements earth water air and fire aristotle added a fifth the ether these elements were regarded not as different kinds of matter but rather as different forms of the one original matter whereby it manifested different properties it was thought that to these elements were due the four primary properties of dryness moistness warmth and coldness each element being supposed to give rise to two of these properties dryness and warmth being thought to be due to fire moistness and warmth to air moistness and coldness to water and dryness and coldness to earth thus moist and cold bodies liquids in general were said to possess these properties in consequence of the aqueous element and were termed waters c also since these elements were not regarded as different kinds of matter transmutation was thought to be possible one being convertible into another as in the example given above the sulphur mercury theory coming to the alchemists we find the view that the metals are all composed of two elementary principles sulphur and mercury in different proportions and degrees of purity well nigh universally accepted in the earlier days of alchemy by these terms sulphur and mercury however must not be understood the common bodies ordinarily designated by these names like the elements of aristotle the alchemistic principles were regarded as properties rather than as substances though it must be confessed that the alchemists were by no means always clear on this point themselves indeed it is not altogether easy to say exactly what the alchemists did mean by these terms and the question is complicated by the fact that very frequently they make mention of different sorts of sulphur and mercury probably however we shall not be far wrong in saying that sulphur was generally regarded as the principle of combustion and also of colour and was said to be present on account of the fact that most metals are changed into earthy substances by the aid of fire and to the mercury the metallic principle par excellence was attributed such properties as fusibility malleability and lustre which were regarded as characteristic of the metals in general the pseudo geber see says that sulphur is a fatness of the earth by temperate decoction in the mine of the earth thickened until it be hardned and made dry he considered an excess of sulphur to be a cause of imperfection in the metals and he writes that one of the causes of the corruption of the metals by fire is the inclusion of a burning sulphuriety in the profundity of their substance diminishing them by inflamation and exterminating also into fume with extream consumption whatsoever argentvive in them is of good fixation he assumed further that the metals contained an incombustible as well as a combustible sulphur the latter sulphur being apparently regarded as an impurity a later alchemist says that sulphur is most easily recognised by the vital spirit in animals the colour in metals the odour in plants mercury on the other hand according to the pseudo geber is the cause of perfection in the metals and endows gold with its lustre another alchemist quoting arnold de villanova writes quicksilver is the elementary form of all things fusible for all things fusible when melted are changed into it and it mingles with them because it is of the same substance with them such bodies differ from quicksilver in their composition only so far as itself is or is not free from the foreign matter of impure sulphur the obtaining of philosophical mercury the imaginary virtues of which the alchemists never tired of relating was generally held to be essential for the attainment of the magnum opus it was commonly thought that it could be prepared from ordinary quicksilver by purificatory processes whereby the impure sulphur supposed to be present in this sort of mercury might be purged away of the sum of perfection see the works of geber translated by richard russel pp and of the sum of perfection see the works of geber p see the works of geber p this view was also held by other alchemists the new chemical light part ii concerning sulphur see the hermetic museum vol ii p see the golden tract concerning the stone of the philosophers the hermetic museum vol i p the sulphur mercury theory of the metals was held by such famous alchemists as roger bacon arnold de villanova and raymond lully until recently it was thought to have originated to a great extent with the arabian alchemist geber but the late professor berthelot showed that the works ascribed to geber in which the theory is put forward are forgeries of a date by which it was already centuries old see occasionally arsenic was regarded as an elementary principle this view is to be found for example in the work of the sum of perfection by the pseudo geber but the idea was not general the sulphur mercury salt theory later in the history of alchemy the mercury sulphur theory was extended by the addition of a third elementary principle salt as in the case of philosophical sulphur and mercury by this term was not meant common salt sodium chloride or any of those substances commonly known as salts salt was the name given to a supposed basic principle in the metals a principle of fixity and solidification conferring the property of resistance to fire in this extended form the theory is found in the works of isaac of holland and in those attributed to basil valentine who see the work of natural and supernatural things attempts to explain the differences in the properties of the metals as the result of the differences in the proportion of sulphur salt and mercury they contain thus copper which is highly coloured is said to contain much sulphur whilst iron is supposed to contain an excess of salt c the sulphur mercury salt theory was vigorously championed by paracelsus and the doctrine gained very general acceptance amongst the alchemists salt however seems generally to have been considered a less important principle than either mercury or sulphur the same germ idea underlying these doctrines is to be found much later in stahl s phlogistic theory eighteenth century which attempted to account for the combustibility of bodies by the assumption that such bodies all contain phlogiston the hypothetical principle of combustion see though the concept of phlogiston approaches more nearly to the modern idea of an element than do the alchemistic elements or principles it was not until still later in the history of chemistry that it became quite evident that the more obvious properties of chemical substances are not specially conferred on them in virtue of certain elements entering into their constitution alchemistic elements and principles the alchemists combined the above theories with aristotle s theory of the elements the latter namely earth air fire and water were regarded as more interior more primary than the principles whose source was said to be these same elements as writes sendivogius in part ii of the new chemical light the three principles of things are produced out of the four elements in the following manner nature whose power is in her obedience to the will of god ordained from the very beginning that the four elements should incessantly act on one another so in obedience to her behest fire began to act on air and produced sulphur air acted on water and produced mercury water by its action on the earth produced salt earth alone having nothing to act upon did not produce anything but became the nurse or womb of these three principles we designedly speak of three principles for though the ancients mention only two it is clear that they omitted the third salt not from ignorance but from a desire to lead the uninitiated astray the new chemical light part ii concerning sulphur see the hermetic museum vol ii pp beneath and within all these coverings of outward properties taught the alchemists is hidden the secret essence of all material things the elements and compounds writes one alchemist in addition to crass matter are composed of a subtle substance or intrinsic radical humidity diffused through the elemental parts simple and wholly incorruptible long preserving the things themselves in vigour and called the spirit of the world proceeding from the soul of the world the one certain life filling and fathoming all things gathering together and connecting all things so that from the three genera of creatures intellectual celestial and corruptible there is formed the one machine of the whole world it is hardly necessary to point out how nearly this approaches modern views regarding the ether of space alexander von suchten man the best and most perfect of god s creatures a more complete exposition of this medical foundation for the less experienced student see benedictus figulus a golden and blessed casket of nature s marvels translated by a e waite pp and the growth of the metals the alchemists regarded the metals as growing in the womb of the earth and a knowledge of this growth as being of very great importance thomas norton who however contrary to the generality of alchemists denied that metals have seed and that they grow in the sense of multiply says mettalls of kinde grow lowe under ground for above erth rust in them is found soe above erth appeareth corruption of mettalls and in long tyme destruction whereof noe cause is found in this case buth that above erth thei be not in their place contrarie places to nature causeth strife as fishes out of water losen their lyfe and man with beasts and birds live in ayer but stones and mineralls under erth repaier thomas norton ordinall of alchemy see theatrum chemicum britannicum edited by elias ashmole p norton here expresses the opinion current among the alchemists that each and every thing has its own peculiar environment natural to it a view controverted by robert boyle so firm was the belief in the growth of metals that mines were frequently closed for a while in order that the supply of metal might be renewed the fertility of mother earth forms the subject of one of the illustrations in the twelve keys of basil valentine see we reproduce it in plate fig a regarding this subject the author writes the quickening power of the earth produces all things that grow forth from it and he who says that the earth has no life makes a statement which is flatly contradicted by the most ordinary facts for what is dead cannot produce life and growth seeing that it is devoid of the quickening spirit this spirit is the life and soul that dwell in the earth and are nourished by heavenly and sidereal influences for all herbs trees and roots and all metals and minerals receive their growth and nutriment from the spirit of the earth which is the spirit of life this spirit is itself fed by the stars and is thereby rendered capable of imparting nutriment to all things that grow and of nursing them as a mother does her child while it is yet in the womb the minerals are hidden in the womb of the earth and nourished by her with the spirit which she receives from above thus the power of growth that i speak of is imparted not by the earth but by the life giving spirit that is in it if the earth were deserted by this spirit it would be dead and no longer able to afford nourishment to anything for its sulphur or richness would lack the quickening spirit without which there can be neither life nor growth basil valentine the twelve keys see the hermetic museum vol i pp illustration plate a symbolical illustration representing the fertility of the earth b symbolical illustration representing the amalgamation of gold with mercury see page to face page alchemy and astrology the idea that the growth of each metal was under the influence of one of the heavenly bodies a theory in harmony with the alchemistic view of the unity of the cosmos was very generally held by the alchemists and in consequence thereof the metals were often referred to by the names or astrological symbols of their peculiar planets these particulars are shown in the following table metals planets c symbols gold sun silver moon mercury mercury copper venus iron mars tin jupiter lead saturn moreover it was thought by some alchemists that a due observance of astrological conditions was necessary for successfully carrying out important alchemistic experiments this supposed connection between the metals and planets also played an important part in talismanic magic alchemistic view of the nature of gold the alchemists regarded gold as the most perfect metal silver being considered more perfect than the rest the reason of this view is not difficult to understand gold is the most beautiful of all the metals and it retains its beauty without tarnishing it resists the action of fire and most corrosive liquids and is unaffected by sulphur it was regarded as we have pointed out above see as symbolical of the regenerate man silver on the other hand is indeed a beautiful metal which wears well in a pure atmosphere and resists the action of fire but it is attacked by certain corrosives e g aqua fortis or nitric acid and also by sulphur through all the metals from the one seed nature according to the alchemists works continuously up to gold so that in a sense all other metals are gold in the making their existence marks the staying of nature s powers as eiren us philalethes says all metallic seed is the seed of gold for gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals if the base metals are not gold it is only through some accidental hindrance they are all potentially gold or as another alchemist puts it since the substance of the metals is one and common to all and since this substance is either at once or after laying aside in course of time the foreign and evil sulphur of the baser metals by a process of gradual digestion changed by the virtue of its own indwelling sulphur into gold which is the goal of all the metals and the true intention of nature we are obliged to admit and freely confess that in the mineral kingdom as well as in the vegetable and animal kingdoms nature seeks and demands a gradual attainment of perfection and a gradual approximation to the highest standard of purity and excellence such was the alchemistic view of the generation of the metals a theory which is admittedly crude but which nevertheless contains the germ of a great principle of the utmost importance namely the idea that all the varying forms of matter are evolved from some one primordial stuff a principle of which chemical science lost sight for awhile for its validity was unrecognised by dalton s atomic theory at least as enunciated by him but which is being demonstrated as we hope to show hereinafter by recent scientific research the alchemist was certainly a fantastic evolutionist but he was an evolutionist and moreover he did not make the curious and paradoxical mistake of regarding the fact of evolution as explaining away the existence of god the alchemist recognised the hand of the divine in nature and although in these days of modern science we cannot accept his theory of the growth of metals we can nevertheless appreciate and accept the fundamental germ idea underlying it eiren us philalethes the metamorphosis of metals see the hermetic museum vol ii p the golden tract concerning the stone of the philosophers see the hermetic museum vol i p the philosopher s stone the alchemist strove to assist nature in her gold making or at least to carry out her methods the pseudo geber taught that the imperfect metals were to be perfected or cured by the application of medicines three forms of medicines were distinguished the first bring about merely a temporary change and the changes wrought by the second class although permanent are not complete a medicine of the third order he writes i call every preparation which when it comes to bodies with its projection takes away all corruption and perfects them with the difference of all compleatment but this is one only this the true medicine that would produce a real and permanent transmutation is the philosopher s stone the masterpiece of alchemistic art similar views were held by all the alchemists though some of them taught that it was necessary first of all to reduce the metals to their first substance often two forms of the philosopher s stone were distinguished or perhaps we should say two degrees of perfection in the one stone that for transmuting the imperfect metals into silver being said to be white the stone or powder of projection for gold being said to be of a red colour in other accounts see chapter v the medicine is described as of a pale brimstone hue of the sum of perfection see the works of geber translated by richard russel p most of the alchemists who claimed knowledge of the philosopher s stone or the materia prima necessary for its preparation generally kept its nature most secret and spoke only in the most enigmatical and allegorical language the majority of their recipes containing words of unknown meaning in some cases gold or silver as the case may be was employed in preparing the medicine and after projection had been made this was of course obtained again in the metallic form the alchemist imagining that a transmutation had been effected in the case of the few other recipes that are intelligible the most that could be obtained by following out their instructions is a white or yellow metallic alloy superficially resembling silver or gold the nature of the philosopher s stone the mystical as distinguished from the pseudo practical descriptions of the stone and its preparation are by far the more interesting of the two paracelsus in his work on the tincture of the philosophers tells us that all that is necessary for us to do is to mix and coagulate the rose coloured blood from the lion and the gluten from the eagle by which he probably meant that we must combine philosophical sulphur with philosophical mercury this opinion that the philosopher s stone consists of philosophical sulphur and mercury combined so as to constitute a perfect unity was commonly held by the alchemists and they frequently likened this union to the conjunction of the sexes in marriage eiren us philalethes tells us that for the preparation of the stone it is necessary to extract the seed of gold though this cannot be accomplished by subjecting gold to corrosive liquids but only by a homogeneous water or liquid the mercury of the sages in the book of the revelation of hermes interpreted by theophrastus paracelsus concerning the supreme secret of the world the medicine which is here as not infrequently identified with the alchemistic essence of all things or soul of the world is described in the following suggestive language this is the spirit of truth which the world cannot comprehend without the interposition of the holy ghost or without the instruction of those who know it the same is of a mysterious nature wondrous strength boundless power by avicenna this spirit is named the soul of the world for as the soul moves all the limbs of the body so also does this spirit move all bodies and as the soul is in all the limbs of the body so also is this spirit in all elementary created things it is sought by many and found by few it is beheld from afar and found near for it exists in every thing in every place and at all times it has the powers of all creatures its action is found in all elements and the qualities of all things are therein even in the highest perfection it heals all dead and living bodies without other medicine converts all metallic bodies into gold and there is nothing like unto it under heaven see benedictus figulus a golden and blessed casket of nature s marvels translated by a e waite pp and the theory of development from the ascetic standpoint and unfortunately most mystics have been somewhat overfond of ascetic ideas the development of the soul is only fully possible with the mortification of the body and all true mysticism teaches that if we would reach the highest goal possible for man union with the divine there must be a giving up of our own individual wills an abasement of the soul before the spirit and so the alchemists taught that for the achievement of the magnum opus on the physical plane we must strip the metals of their outward properties in order to develop the essence within as says helvetius the essences of metals are hidden in their outward bodies as the kernel is hidden in the nut every earthly body whether animal vegetable or mineral is the habitation and terrestrial abode of that celestial spirit or influence which is its principle of life or growth the secret of alchemy is the destruction of the body which enables the artist to get at and utilise for his own purposes the living soul this killing of the outward nature of material things was to be brought about by the processes of putrefaction and decay hence the reason why such processes figure so largely in alchemistic recipes for the preparation of the divine magistery it must be borne in mind however that the alchemists used the terms putrefaction and decay rather indiscriminately applying them to chemical processes which are no longer regarded as such pictorial symbols of death and decay representative of such processes are to be found in several alchemistic books there is a curious series of pictures in a form and method of perfecting base metals by janus lacinus the calabrian a short tract prefixed to the new pearl of great price by peter bonus see of which we show three examples in plates and in the first picture of the series not shown here we enter the palace of the king gold and observe him sitting crowned upon his throne surrounded by his son mercury and five servants silver copper tin iron and lead in the next picture plate fig b the son incited by the servants kills his father and in the third he catches the blood of his murdered parent in his robes whereby we understand that an amalgam of gold and mercury is to be prepared the gold apparently disappearing or dying whilst the mercury is coloured thereby the next picture shows us a grave being dug i e a furnace is to be made ready in the fifth picture in the series the son thought to throw his father into the grave and to leave him there but both fell in together and in the sixth picture plate fig a we see the son being prevented from escaping both son and father being left in the grave to decay here we have instructions in symbolical form to place the amalgam in a sealed vessel in the furnace and to allow it to remain there until some change is observed so the allegory proceeds ultimately the father is restored to life the symbol of resurrection being as might be expected of frequent occurrence in alchemistic literature by this resurrection we understand that the gold will finally be obtained in a pure form indeed it is now the great medicine and in the last picture of the series plate fig b the king s son and his five servants are all made kings in virtue of its powers j f helvetius the golden calf ch iv see the hermetic museum vol ii p illustration plate a symbolical illustration representing the coction of gold amalgam in a closed vessel b symbolical illustration representing the transmutation of the metals to face page the powers of the philosopher s stone the alchemists believed that a most minute proportion of the stone projected upon considerable quantities of heated mercury molten lead or other base metal would transmute practically the whole into silver or gold this claim of the alchemists that a most minute quantity of the stone was sufficient to transmute considerable quantities of base metal has been the object of much ridicule certainly some of the claims of the alchemists understood literally are out of all reason but on the other hand the disproportion between the quantities of stone and transmuted metal cannot be advanced as an priori objection to the alchemists claims inasmuch that a class of chemical reactions called catalytic is known in which the presence of a small quantity of some appropriate form of matter the catalyst brings about a chemical change in an indefinite quantity of some other form or forms thus for example cane sugar in aqueous solution is converted into two other sugars by the action of small quantities of acid and sulphur dioxide and oxygen which will not combine under ordinary conditions do so readily in the presence of a small quantity of platinized asbestos which is obtained unaltered after the reaction is completed and may be used over and over again this process is actually employed in the manufacture of sulphuric acid or oil of vitriol however whether any such catalytic transmutation of the chemical elements is possible is merely conjecture the elixir of life the elixir of life which was generally described as a solution of the stone in spirits of wine or identified with the stone itself could be applied so it was thought under certain conditions to the alchemist himself with an entirely analogous result i e it would restore him to the flower of youth the idea not infrequently attributed to the alchemists that the elixir would endow one with a life of endless duration on the material plane is not in strict accord with alchemistic analogy from this point of view the effect of the elixir is physiological perfection which although ensuring long life is not equivalent to endless life on the material plane the philosophers stone says paracelsus purges the whole body of man and cleanses it from all impurities by the introduction of new and more youthful forces which it joins to the nature of man and in another work expressive of the opinions of the same alchemist we read there is nothing which might deliver the mortal body from death but there is one thing which may postpone decay renew youth and prolong short human life in the theory that a solution of the philosopher s stone which it must be remembered was thought to be of a species with gold constituted the elixir vit can be traced perhaps the idea that gold in a potable form was a veritable cure all in the latter days of alchemy any yellow coloured liquid was

chapter with some few remarks regarding the practical methods of the alchemists in their experiments the alchemists worked with very large quantities of material compared with what is employed in chemical researches at the present day they had great belief in the efficacy of time to effect a desired change in their substances and they were wont to repeat the same operation such as distillation for example on the same material over and over again which demonstrated their unwearied patience even if it effected little towards the attainment of their end they paid much attention to any changes of colour they observed in their experiments and many descriptions of supposed methods to achieve the magnum opus contain detailed directions as to the various changes of colour which must be obtained in the material operated upon if a successful issue to the experiment is desired in plates and we give illustrations of some characteristic pieces of apparatus employed by the alchemists plate fig a and plate fig a are from a work known as alchemiae gebri plate fig b is from glauber s work on furnaces and plate fig b is from a work by dr john french entitled the art of distillation the first figure shows us a furnace and alembics the alembic proper is a sort of still head which can be luted on to a flask or other vessel and was much used for distillations in the present case however the alembics are employed in conjunction with apparatus for subliming difficultly volatile substances plate fig b shows another apparatus for sublimation consisting of a sort of oven and three detachable upper chambers generally called aludels in both forms of apparatus the vapours are cooled in the upper part of the vessel and the substance is deposited in the solid form being thereby purified from less volatile impurities plate fig a shows an athanor or digesting furnace and a couple of digesting vessels a vessel of this sort was employed for heating bodies in a closed space the top being sealed up when the substances to be operated upon had been put inside and the vessel heated in ashes in an athanor a uniform temperature being maintained the pelican illustrated in plate fig b was used for a similar purpose the two arms being added in the idea that the vapours would be circulated thereby as writes espagnet in his hermetic arcanum canons and the means or demonstrative signs are colours successively and orderly affecting the matter and its affections and demonstrative passions whereof there are also three special ones as critical to be noted to these some add a fourth the first is black which is called the crow s head because of its extreme blackness whose crepusculum sheweth the beginning of the action of the fire of nature and solution and the blackest midnight sheweth the perfection of liquefaction and confusion of the elements then the grain putrefies and is corrupted that it may be the more apt for generation the white colour succeedeth the black wherein is given the perfection of the first degree and of the white sulphur this is called the blessed stone this earth is white and foliated wherein philosophers do sow their gold the third is orange colour which is produced in the passage of the white to the red as the middle and being mixed of both is as the dawn with his saffron hair a forerunner of the sun the fourth colour is ruddy and sanguine which is extracted from the white fire only now because whiteness is easily altered by any other colour before day it quickly faileth of its candour but the deep redness of the sun perfecteth the work of sulphur which is called the sperm of the male the fire of the stone the king s crown and the son of sol wherein the first labour of the workman resteth besides these decretory signs which firmly inhere in the matter and shew its essential mutations almost infinite colours appear and shew themselves in vapours as the rainbow in the clouds which quickly pass away and are expelled by those that succeed more affecting the air than the earth the operator must have a gentle care of them because they are not permanent and proceed not from the intrinsic disposition of the matter but from the fire

mystical meaning as well as a supposed application in the preparation of the physical stone illustration plate alchemistic apparatus a an athanor b a pelican to face page chapter iii the alchemists a before paracelsus hermes trismegistos having now considered the chief points in the theory of physical alchemy we must turn our attention to the lives and individual teachings of the alchemists themselves the first name which is found in the history of alchemy is that of hermes trismegistos we have already mentioned the high esteem in which the works ascribed to this personage were held by the alchemists he has been regarded as the father of alchemy his name has supplied a synonym for the art the hermetic art and even to day we speak of hermetically sealing flasks and the like but who hermes actually was or even if there were such a personage is a matter of conjecture the alchemists themselves supposed him to have been an egyptian living about the time of moses he is now generally regarded as purely mythical a personification of thoth the egyptian god of learning but of course some person or persons must have written the works attributed to him and the first of such writers if as seems not unlikely there were more than one may be considered to have a right to the name of these works the divine pymander a mystical religious treatise is the most important the golden tractate also attributed to hermes which is an exceedingly obscure alchemistic work is now regarded as having been written at a comparatively late date it is perhaps advisable to mention here that the lives of the alchemists for the most part are enveloped in considerable obscurity and many points in connection therewith are in dispute the authorities we have followed will be found as a rule specifically mentioned in what follows but we may here acknowledge our general indebtedness to the following works though as the reader will observe many others have been consulted as well thomas thomson s the history of chemistry meyer s a history of chemistry the anonymous lives of alchemystical philosophers the works of mr a e waite the dictionary of national biography and certain articles in the encyclop dia britannica this must not be taken to mean however that we have always followed the conclusions reached in these works for so far as the older of them are concerned recent researches by various authorities to whom reference will be found in the following pages and to whom also we are indebted have shown in certain cases that such are not tenable dr everard s translation of this work forms vol ii of the collectanea hermetica edited by w wynn westcott m b d p h it is now however out of print the smaragdine table in a work attributed to albertus magnus but which is probably spurious we are told that alexander the great found the tomb of hermes in a cave near hebron this tomb contained an emerald table the smaragdine table on which were inscribed the following thirteen sentences in ph nician characters i speak not fictitious things but what is true and most certain what is below is like that which is above and what is above is like that which is below to accomplish the miracles of one thing and as all things were produced by the mediation of one being so all things were produced from this one thing by adaptation its father is the sun its mother the moon the wind carries it in its belly its nurse is the earth it is the cause of all perfection throughout the whole world its power is perfect if it be changed into earth separate the earth from the fire the subtle from the gross acting prudently and with judgment ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and all obscurity will fly far away from you this thing is the fortitude of all fortitude because it overcomes all subtle things and penetrates every solid thing thus were all things created thence proceed wonderful adaptations which are produced in this way therefore am i called hermes trismegistos possessing the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world that which i had to say concerning the operation of the sun is completed these sentences clearly teach the doctrine of the alchemistic essence or one thing which is everywhere present penetrating even solids this we should note is true of the ether of space and out of which all things of the physical world are made by adaptation or modification the terms sun and moon in the above passage probably stand for spirit and matter respectively not gold and silver zosimus of panopolis one of the earliest of the alchemists of whom record remains was zosimus of panopolis who flourished in the fifth century and was regarded by the later alchemists as a master of the art he is said to have written many treatises dealing with alchemy but only fragments remain of these fragments professor venable says they give us a good idea of the learning of the man and of his times they contain descriptions of apparatus of furnaces studies of minerals of alloys of glass making of mineral waters and much that is mystical besides a good deal referring to the transmutation of metals zosimus is said to have been the author of the saying like begets like but whether all the fragments ascribed to him were really his work is doubtful f p venable ph d a short history of chemistry p among other early alchemists we may mention also africanus the syrian synesius bishop of ptolemais and the historian olympiodorus of thebes geber in the seventh century the arabians conquered egypt and strangely enough alchemy flourished under them to a remarkable degree of all the arabian alchemists geber has been regarded as the greatest as professor meyer says there can be no dispute that with the name geber was propagated the memory of a personality with which the chemical knowledge of the time was bound up geber is supposed to have lived about the ninth century but of his life nothing definite is known a large number of works have been ascribed to him of which the majority are unknown but the four latin mss which have been printed under the titles summa perfectionis mettalorum de investigatione perfectionis metallorum de inventione veritatis and de fornacibus construendis were until a few years ago regarded as genuine on the strength of these works geber has ranked high as a chemist in them are described the preparation of many important chemical compounds the most essential chemical operations such as sublimation distillation filtration crystallisation or coagulation as the alchemists called it c and also important chemical apparatus for example the water bath improved furnaces c however it was shown by the late professor berthelot that summa perfectionis mettalorum is a forgery of the fourteenth century and the other works forgeries of an even later date moreover the original arabic mss of geber have been brought to light these true writings of geber are very obscure they give no warrant for believing that the famous sulphur mercury theory was due to this alchemist and they prove him not to be the expert chemist that he was supposed to have been the spurious writings mentioned above show that the pseudo geber was a man of wide chemical knowledge and experience and play a not inconsiderable part in the history of alchemy ernst von meyer a history of chemistry translated by dr mcgowan p other arabian alchemists among other arabian alchemists the most celebrated were avicenna and rhasis who are supposed to have lived some time after geber and to whom perhaps the sulphur mercury theory may have been to some extent due the teachings of the arabian alchemists gradually penetrated into the western world in which during the thirteenth century flourished some of the most eminent of the alchemists whose lives and teachings we must now briefly consider illustration plate by de bry portrait of albertus magnus to face page albertus magnus albertus magnus albert groot or albert von bollst dt see plate was born at lauingen probably in he was educated at padua and in his later years he showed himself apt at acquiring the knowledge of his time he studied theology philosophy and natural science and is chiefly celebrated as an aristotelean philosopher he entered the dominican order taught publicly at cologne paris and elsewhere and was made provincial of this order later he had the bishopric of regensburg conferred on him but he retired after a few years to a dominican cloister where he devoted himself to philosophy and science he was one of the most learned men of his time and moreover a man of noble character the authenticity of the alchemistic works attributed to him has been questioned thomas aquinas the celebrated dominican thomas aquinas see plate was probably a pupil of albertus magnus from whom it is thought he imbibed alchemistic learning it is very probable however that the alchemistic works attributed to him are spurious the author of these works manifests a deeply religious tone and according to thomson s history of chemistry he was the first to employ the term amalgam to designate an alloy of mercury with some other metal thomas thomson the history of chemistry vol i p roger bacon roger bacon the most illustrious of the medi val alchemists was born near ilchester in somerset probably in his erudition considering the general state of ignorance prevailing at this time was most remarkable professor meyer says he is to be regarded as the intellectual originator of experimental research if the departure in this direction is to be coupled with any one name a direction which followed more and more as time went on gave to the science of chemistry its own peculiar stamp and ensured its steady development roger bacon studied theology and science at oxford and at paris and he joined the franciscan order at what date however is uncertain he was particularly interested in optics and certain discoveries in this branch of physics have been attributed to him though probably erroneously it appears also that he was acquainted with gunpowder which was however not employed in europe until many years later unfortunately he earned the undesirable reputation of being in communication with the powers of darkness and as he did not hesitate to oppose many of the opinions current at the time he suffered much persecution he was a firm believer in the powers of the philosopher s stone to transmute large quantities of base metal into gold and also to extend the life of the individual alchimy he says is a science teaching how to transforme any kind of mettall into another and that by a proper medicine as it appeareth by many philosophers bookes alchimy therefore is a science teaching how to make and compound a certaine medicine which is called elixir the which when it is cast upon mettals or imperfect bodies doth fully perfect them in the verie projection he also believed in astrology but nevertheless he was entirely opposed to many of the magical and superstitious notions held at the time and his tract de secretis operibus artis et natur et de nullitate magi was an endeavour to prove that many so called miracles could be brought about simply by the aid of natural science roger bacon was a firm supporter of the sulphur mercury theory he says the natural principles in the mynes are argent vive and sulphur all mettals and minerals whereof there be sundrie and divers kinds are begotten of these two but i must tel you that nature alwaies intendeth and striveth to the perfection of gold but many accidents coming between change the metalls for according to the puritie and impuritie of the two aforesaide principles argent vive and sulphur pure and impure mettals are ingendred he expresses surprise that any should employ animal and vegetable substances in their attempts to prepare the stone a practice common to some alchemists but warmly criticised by others he says nothing may be mingled with mettalls which hath not beene made or sprung from them it remaineth cleane inough that no strange thing which hath not his originall from these two viz sulphur and mercury is able to perfect them or to make a chaunge and new transmutation of them so that it is to be wondered at that any wise man should set his mind upon living creatures or vegetables which are far off when there be minerals to bee found nigh enough neither may we in any wise thinke that any of the philosophers placed the art in the said remote things except it were by way of comparison the one process necessary for the preparation of the stone he tells us is continuall concoction in the fire which is the method that god hath given to nature he died about ernst von meyer a history of chemistry translated by dr mcgowan p see roger bacon s discovery of

uncertain he studied medicine at paris and in the latter part of the thirteenth century practised professionally in barcelona to avoid persecution at the hands of the inquisition he was obliged to leave spain and ultimately found safety with frederick ii in sicily he was famous not only as an alchemist but also as a skilful physician he died it is thought in a shipwreck about raymond lully raymond lully the son of a noble spanish family was born at palma in majorca about he was a man of somewhat eccentric character in his youth a man of pleasure in his maturity a mystic and ascetic his career was of a roving and adventurous character we are told that in his younger days although married he became violently infatuated with a lady of the name of ambrosia de castello who vainly tried to dissuade him from his profane passion her efforts proving futile she requested lully to call upon her and in the presence of her husband bared to his sight her breast which was almost eaten away by a cancer this sight so the story goes brought about lully s conversion he became actuated by the idea of converting to christianity the heathen in africa and engaged the services of an arabian whereby he might learn the language the man however discovering his master s object attempted to assassinate him and lully narrowly escaped with his life but his enthusiasm for missionary work never abated his central idea was the reasonableness and demonstrability of christian doctrine and unhappily he was at last stoned to death by the inhabitants of bugiah in algeria in see lives of alchemystical philosophers pp et seq a very large number of alchemistic theological and other treatises are attributed to lully many of which are undoubtedly spurious and it is a difficult question to decide exactly which are genuine he is supposed to have derived a knowledge of alchemy from roger bacon and arnold de villanova it appears more probable however either that lully the alchemist was a personage distinct from the lully whose life we have sketched above or that the alchemistic writings attributed to him are forgeries of a similar nature to the works of pseudo geber of these alchemical writings we may here mention the clavicula this he says is the key to all his other books on alchemy in which books the whole art is fully declared though so obscurely as not to be understandable without its aid in this work an alleged method for what may be called the multiplication of the noble metals rather than transmutation is described in clear language but it should be noticed that the stone employed is itself a compound either of silver or gold according to lully the secret of the philosopher s stone is the extraction of the mercury of silver or gold he writes metals cannot be transmuted in the minerals unless they be reduced into their first matter therefore i counsel you o my friends that you do not work but about sol and luna reducing them into the first matter our sulphur and argent vive therefore son you are to use this venerable matter and i swear unto you and promise that unless you take the argent vive of these two you go to the practick as blind

abridgement by janus lacinus therapus the calabrian of a ms written by peter bonus in the fourteenth century an abridged english translation of this book by mr a e waite was published in of the life of bonus who is said to have been an inhabitant of pola a seaport of istria nothing is known but the magarita pretiosa is an alchemistic work of considerable interest the author commences like pseudo geber in his sum of perfection by bringing forward a number of very ingenious arguments against the validity of the art he then proceeds with arguments in favour of alchemy and puts forward answers in full to the former objections further difficulties c are then dealt with in all this compared with many other alchemists bonus though somewhat prolix is remarkably lucid all metals he argues following the views of pseudo geber consist of mercury and sulphur but whilst the mercury is always one and the same different metals contain different sulphurs there are also two different kinds of sulphurs inward and outward sulphur is necessary for the development of the mercury but for the final product gold to come forth it is necessary that the outward and impure sulphur be purged off each metal says bonus differs from all the rest and has a certain perfection and completeness of its own but none except gold has reached that highest degree of perfection of which it is capable for all common metals there is a transient and a perfect state of inward completeness and this perfect state they attain either through the slow operation of nature or through the sudden transformatory power of our stone we must however add that the imperfect metals form part of the great plan and design of nature though they are in course of transformation into gold for a large number of very useful and indispensable tools and utensils could not be provided at all if there were no copper iron tin or lead and if all metals were either silver or gold for this beneficent reason nature has furnished us with the metallic substance in all its different stages of development from iron or the lowest to gold or the highest state of metallic perfection nature is ever studying variety and for that reason instead of covering the whole face of the earth with water has evolved out of that elementary substance a great diversity of forms embracing the whole animal vegetable and mineral world it is in like manner for the use of men that nature has differentiated the metallic substance into a great variety of species and forms according to this interesting alchemistic work the art of alchemy consists not in reducing the imperfect metals to their first substance but in carrying forward nature s work developing the imperfect metals to perfection and removing their impure sulphur peter bonus the new pearl of great price mr a e waite s translation pp nicolas flamel nicolas flamel see plate was born about probably in paris his parents were poor and nicolas took up the trade of a scrivener in the course of time flamel became a very wealthy man and at the same time it appears one who exhibited considerable munificence this increase in flamel s wealth has been attributed to supposed success in the hermetic art we are told that a remarkable book came into the young scrivener s possession which at first he was unable to understand until at last he had the good fortune to meet an adept who translated its mysteries for him this book revealed the occult secrets of alchemy and by its means nicolas was enabled to obtain immense quantities of gold this story however appears to be of a legendary nature and it seems more likely that flamel s riches resulted from his business as a scrivener and from moneylending at any rate all of the alchemistic works attributed to flamel are of more or less questionable origin one of these entitled a short tract or philosophical summary will be found in the hermetic museum it is a very brief work supporting the sulphur mercury theory illustration plate portrait of thomas aquinas portrait of nicolas flamel to face page basil valentine and the triumphal chariot of antimony probably the most celebrated of all alchemistic books is the work known as triumph wagen des antimonii a latin translation with a commentary by theodore kerckringius was published in and an english translation of this version by mr a e waite appeared in the author describes himself as basil valentine a benedictine monk in his practica another alchemistic work he says when i had emptied to the dregs the cup of human suffering i was led to consider the wretchedness of this world and the fearful consequences of our first parents disobedience i made haste to withdraw myself from the evil world to bid farewell to it and to devote myself to the service of god he proceeds to relate that he entered a monastery but finding that he had some time on his hands after performing his daily work and devotions and not wishing to pass this time in idleness he took up the study of alchemy the investigation of those natural secrets by which god has shadowed out eternal things and at last his labours were rewarded by the discovery of a stone most potent in the curing of diseases in the triumphal chariot of antimony are accurately described a large number of antimonial preparations and as basil was supposed to have written this work some time in the fifteenth century these preparations were accordingly concluded to have been for the most part his own discoveries he defends with the utmost vigour the medicinal values of antimony and criticises in terms far from mild the physicians of his day on account of this work basil valentine has ranked very high as an experimental chemist but from quite early times its date and authorship have been regarded alike as doubtful and it appears from the researches of the late professor schorlemmer to be an undoubted forgery dating from about the information being culled from the works of other writers probably the other works ascribed to basil valentine are of a like nature the triumphal chariot of antimony does however give an accurate account of the knowledge of antimony of this time and

are supposed to have lived during the fifteenth century but of their lives nothing is known isaac although not free from superstitious opinions appears to have been a practical chemist and his works which abound in recipes were held in great esteem by paracelsus and other alchemists he held that all things in this world are of a dual nature partly good and partly bad all that god hath created good in the upper part of the world he writes are perfect and uncorruptible as the heaven but whatsoever in these lower parts whether it be in beasts fishes and all manner of sensible creatures hearbs

hath put a secret nature or influence in every creature and to every nature of one sort or kind he hath given one common influence and vertue whether it bee on physick or other secret works which partly are found out by naturall workmanship and yet more things are unknown than are apparent to our senses he gives directions for extracting the quintessence for which marvellous powers are claimed out of sugar and other organic substances and he appears to be the earliest known writer who makes mention of the famous sulphur mercury salt theory one hundred and fourteen experiments and cures of

fifteenth century squandered enormous sums of money in the search for the stone in which the whole of his life and energies were engaged he seems to have become the dupe of one charlatan after another but at last at a ripe old age he says that his labours were rewarded and that he successfully performed the magnum opus in a short but rather obscure work he speaks of the philosopher s stone in the following words this stone then is compounded of a body and spirit or of a volatile and fixed substance and that is therefore done because nothing in the world can be generated and brought to light without these two substances to wit a male and female from whence it appeareth that although these two substances are not of one and the same species yet one stone doth thence arise and although they appear and are said to be two substances yet in truth it is but one to wit argent vive he appears however to have added nothing to our knowledge of chemical science bernard earl of tr visan a treatise

himself to the study of the hermetic art his chief work is the compound of alchymie conteining twelve gates which was written in in this curious work we learn that there are twelve processes necessary for the achievement of the magnum opus namely calcination solution separation conjunction putrefaction congelation cibation sublimation fermentation exaltation multiplication and projection these are likened to the twelve gates of a castle which the philosopher must enter at the conclusion of the twelfth gate ripley says now thou hast conqueryd the twelve gates and all the castell thou holdyst at

samuel norton the grandson of thomas who was also an alchemist says that thomas norton was a member of the privy chamber of edward iv norton s distinctive views regarding the generation of the metals we have already mentioned see he taught that true knowledge of the art of alchemy could only be obtained by word of mouth from an adept and in his ordinall he gives an account of his own initiation he tells us that he was instructed by his master probably sir george ripley and learnt the secrets of the art in forty days at the age of twenty eight he does not however appear to have reaped the fruits of this knowledge twice he tells us did he prepare the elixir and twice was it stolen from him and he is said to have died in after ruining himself and his friends by his unsuccessful experiments chapter iv the alchemists continued b paracelsus and after paracelsus that erratic genius paracelsus or to give him his correct name philip aureole theophrast bombast von hohenheim whose portrait forms the frontispiece to the present work was born at einsiedeln in switzerland in he studied the alchemistic and medical arts under his father who was a physician and continued his studies later at the university of basle he also gave some time to the study of magic and the occult sciences under the famous trithemius of spanheim paracelsus however found the merely theoretical book learning of the university curriculum unsatisfactory and betook himself to the mines where he might study the nature of metals at first hand he then spent several years in travelling visiting some of the chief countries of europe at last he returned to basle the chair of medical science of his old university being bestowed upon him the works of isaac of holland had inspired him with the desire to improve upon the medical science of his day and in his lectures which were contrary to the usual custom delivered not in latin but in the german language he denounced in violent terms the teachings of galen and avicenna who were until then the accredited authorities on medical matters his use of the german tongue his coarseness in criticism and his intense self esteem combined with the fact that he did lay bare many of the medical follies and frauds of his day brought him into very general dislike with the rest of the physicians and the municipal authorities siding with the aggrieved apothecaries and physicians whose methods paracelsus had exposed he fled from basle and resumed his former roving life he was so we are told a man of very intemperate habits being seldom sober a statement seriously open to doubt but on the other hand he certainly accomplished a very large number of most remarkable cures and judging from his writings he was inspired by lofty and noble ideals and a fervent belief in the christian religion he died in paracelsus combined in himself such opposite characteristics that it is a matter of difficulty to criticise him aright as says professor ferguson it is most difficult to ascertain what his true character really was to appreciate aright this man of fervid imagination of powerful and persistent conviction of unbated honesty and love of truth of keen insight into the errors as he thought them of his time of a merciless will to lay bare these errors and to reform the abuses to which they gave rise who in an instant offends by his boasting his grossness his want of self respect it is a problem how to reconcile his ignorance his weakness his superstition his crude notions his erroneous observations his ridiculous inferences and theories with his grasp of method his lofty views of the true scope of medicine his lucid statements his incisive and epigrammatic criticisms of men and motives it is also a problem of considerable difficulty to determine which of the many books attributed to him are really his genuine works and consequently what his views on certain points exactly were john ferguson m a article paracelsus encyclop dia britannica th edition vol xviii p views of paracelsus paracelsus was the first to recognise the desirability of investigating the physical universe with a motive other than alchemistic he taught that the object of chemistry is not to make gold but to prepare medicines and founded the school of iatro chemistry or medical chemistry this synthesis of chemistry with medicine was of very great benefit to each science new possibilities of chemical investigation were opened up now that the aim was not purely alchemistic paracelsus s central theory was that of the analogy between man the microcosm and the world or macrocosm he regarded all the actions that go on in the human body as of a chemical nature and he thought that illness was the result of a disproportion in the body between the quantities of the three great principles sulphur mercury and salt which he regarded as constituting all things for example he considered an excess of sulphur as the cause of fever since sulphur was the fiery principle c the basis of the iatro chemical doctrines namely that the healthy human body is a particular combination of chemical substances illness the result of some change in this combination and hence curable only by chemical medicines expresses a certain truth and is undoubtedly a great improvement upon the ideas of the ancients but in the elaboration of his medical doctrines paracelsus fell a prey to exaggeration and the fantastic and many of his theories appear to be highly ridiculous this extravagance is also very pronounced in the alchemistic works attributed to him for example the belief in the artificial creation of minute living creatures resembling men called homunculi a belief of the utmost absurdity if we are to understand it literally on the other hand his writings do contain much true teaching of a mystical nature his doctrine of the correspondence of man with the universe considered as a whole for example certainly being radically true though fantastically stated and developed by paracelsus himself iatro chemistry between the pupils of paracelsus and the older school of medicine as might well be supposed a battle royal was waged for a considerable time which ultimately concluded if not with a full vindication of paracelsus s teaching yet with the acceptance of the fundamental iatro chemical doctrines henceforward it is necessary to distinguish between the chemists and the alchemists to distinguish those who pursued chemical studies with the object of discovering and preparing useful medicines and later those who pursued such studies for their own sake from those whose object was the transmutation of the base metals into gold whether from purely selfish motives or with the desire to demonstrate on the physical plane the validity of the doctrines of mysticism however during the following century or two we find very often the chemist and the alchemist united in one and the same person men such as glauber and boyle whose names will ever be remembered by chemists did not doubt the possibility of performing the magnum opus in the present chapter however we shall confine our attention for the most part to those men who may be regarded for one reason or another particularly as alchemists and the alchemists of the period we are now considering present a very great diversity on the one hand we have men of much chemical knowledge and skill such as libavius and van helmont on the other hand we have those who stand equally as high as exponents of mystic wisdom men such as jacob boehme and to a less extent thomas vaughan we have those who although they did not enrich the science of chemistry with any new discoveries were nevertheless regarded as masters of the hermetic art and finally we have alchemists of the edward kelley and cagliostro type whose main object was their own enrichment at their neighbours expense before however proceeding to an account of the lives and teachings of these men there is one curious matter perhaps the most remarkable of all historical curiosities that calls for some brief consideration we refer to the far famed rosicrucian society the rosicrucian society the exoteric history of the rosicrucian society commences with the year in that year there was published at cassel in germany a pamphlet entitled the discovery of the fraternity of the meritorious order of the rosy cross addressed to the learned in general and the governors of europe after a discussion of the momentous question of the general reformation of the world which was to be accomplished through the medium of a secret confederacy of the wisest and most philanthropic men the pamphlet proceeds to inform its readers that such an association is in existence founded over one hundred years ago by the famous c r c grand initiate in the mysteries of alchemy whose history which is clearly of a fabulous or symbolical nature is given the book concludes by inviting the wise men of the time to join the fraternity directing those who wished to do so to indicate their desire by the publication of printed letters which should come into the hands of the brotherhood as might well be expected the pamphlet was the cause of considerable interest and excitement but although many letters were printed apparently none of them were vouchsafed a reply the following year a further pamphlet appeared the confession of the rosicrucian fraternity addressed to the learned in europe and in the chymical nuptials of christian rosencreutz this latter book is a remarkable allegorical romance describing how an old man a lifelong student of the alchemistic art was present at the accomplishment of the magnum opus in the year an enormous amount of controversy took place it was plain to some that the society had deluded them whilst others hotly maintained its claims but after about four years had passed the excitement had subsided and the subject ceased for the time being to arouse any particular interest some writers even in recent times more gifted for romance than for historical research have seen in the rosicrucian society a secret confederacy of immense antiquity and of stupendous powers consisting of the great initiates of all ages supposed to be in possession of the arch secrets of alchemistic art it is abundantly evident however that it was nothing of the sort it is clear from an examination of the pamphlets already mentioned that they are animated by lutheran ideals and it is of interest to note that luther s seal contained both the cross and the rose whence the term rosicrucian the generally accepted theory regards the pamphlets as a sort of elaborate hoax perpetrated by valentine andre a young and benevolent lutheran divine but more however than a mere hoax as the late mr r a vaughan wrote this andre writes the discovery of the rosicrucian brotherhood a jeu d esprit with a serious purpose just as an experiment to see whether something cannot be done by combined effort to remedy the defect and abuses social educational and religious so lamented by all good men he thought there were many andre s scattered throughout europe how powerful would be their united systematic action he hoped that the few nobler minds whom he desired to organize would see through the veil of fiction in which he had invested his proposal that he might communicate personally with some such if they should appear or that his book might lead them to form among themselves a practical philanthropic confederacy answering to the serious purpose he had embodied in his fiction his scheme was a failure and on seeing its result andre not daring to reveal himself as the author of the pamphlets did his best to put a stop to the folly by writing several works in criticism of the society and its claims mr a e waite however whose work on the subject should be consulted for further information rejects this theory and suggests that the rosicrucian society was probably identical with the militia

edward waite the real history of the rosicrucians thomas charnock we must now turn our attention to the lives and teachings of the alchemists of the period under consideration treating them as far as possible in chronological order whence the first alchemist to come under our notice is thomas charnock thomas charnock was born at faversham kent either in the year or in after some travels over england he settled at oxford carrying on experiments in alchemy in he wrote his breviary of philosophy this work is almost entirely autobiographical describing charnock s alchemistic experiences he tells us that he was initiated into the mysteries of the hermetic art by a certain james s of salisbury he also had another master an old blind man who on his death bed instructed charnock unfortunately however thomas was doomed to failure in his experiments on the first attempt his apparatus caught fire and his work was destroyed his next experiments were ruined by the negligence of a servant his final misfortune shall be described in his own words he had started the work for a third time and had spent much money on his fire hoping to be shortly rewarded then a gentleman that

is perhaps unnecessary to say that his name does not appear in the history of chemistry andreas libavius andreas libavius was born at halle in germany in where he studied medicine and practiced for a short time as a physician he accepted the fundamental iatro chemical doctrines at the same time however criticising certain of the more extravagant views expressed by paracelsus he was a firm believer in the transmutation of the metals but his own activities were chiefly directed to the preparation of new and better medicines he enriched the science of chemistry by many valuable discoveries and tin tetra chloride which he was the first to prepare is still known by the name of spiritus fumans libavii libavius was a man possessed of keen powers of observation and his work on chemistry which contains a full account of the knowledge of the science of his time may be regarded as the first text book of chemistry it was held in high esteem for a considerable time being reprinted on several occasions illustration plate portrait of edward kelley portrait of john dee to face page edward kelley and john dee edward kelley or kelly see plate was born at worcester on august his life is so obscured by various traditions that it is very difficult to arrive at the truth concerning it the latest and probably the best account will be found in miss charlotte fell smith s john dee edward kelley according to some accounts was brought up as an apothecary he is also said to have entered oxford university under the pseudonym of talbot later he practised as a notary in london he is said to have committed a forgery for which he had his ears cropped but another account which supposes him to have avoided this penalty by making his escape to wales is not improbable other crimes of which he is accused are coining and necromancy he was probably not guilty of all these crimes but that he was undoubtedly a charlatan and profligate the sequel will make plain we are told that about the time of his alleged escape to wales whilst in the neighbourhood of glastonbury abbey he became possessed by a lucky chance of a manuscript by st dunstan setting forth the grand secrets of alchemy together with some of the two transmuting tinctures both white and red which had been discovered in a tomb near by his friendship with john dee or dr dee as he is generally called commenced in now john dee see plate was undoubtedly a mathematician of considerable erudition he was also an astrologer and was much interested in experiments in crystal gazing for which purpose he employed a speculum of polished cannel coal and by means of which he believed that he had communication with the inhabitants of spiritual spheres it appears that kelley who probably did possess some mediumistic powers the results of which he augmented by means of fraud interested himself in these experiments and not only became the doctor s scryer but also gulled him into the belief that he was in the possession of the arch secrets of alchemy in kelley and his learned dupe left england together with their wives and a polish nobleman staying firstly at cracovia and afterwards at prague where it is not unlikely that the emperor rudolph ii knighted kelley as instances of the belief which the doctor had in kelley s powers as an alchemist we may note that in his private diary under the date december dee records that kelley performed a transmutation for the benefit of one edward garland and his brother francis and under the date may we find the following recorded e k did open the great secret to me god be thanked that he was not always without doubts as to kelley s honesty however is evident from other entries in his diary in occurred an event which must be recorded to the partners lasting shame to cap his former impositions kelley informed the doctor that by the orders of a spirit which had appeared to him in the crystal they were to share their two wives in common to which arrangement after some further persuasion dee consented kelley s profligacy and violent temper however had already been the cause of some disagreement between him and the doctor and this incident leading to a further quarrel the erstwhile friends parted in the emperor rudolph imprisoned kelley the price of his freedom being the transmutative secret or a substantial quantity of gold at least prepared by its aid he was however released in but died in according to one account as the result of an accident incurred while attempting to escape from a second imprisonment dee merely records that he received news to the effect that kelley was slayne see for example william lilly history of his life and times reprinted in p see anthony wood s account of kelley s life in athen oxonienses rd edition edited by philip bliss vol i col william lilly the astrologer in his history of his life and times reprint pp relates a different story regarding the manner in which kelley is supposed to have obtained the great medicine but as it is told at third hand it is of little importance we do not suppose that there can be much doubt that the truth was that dee and others were deceived by some skilful conjuring tricks for whatever else kelley may have been he certainly was a very ingenious fellow the private diary of dr john dee the camden society p the private diary of dr john dee the camden society p it was during his incarceration that he wrote an alchemistic work entitled the stone of the philosophers which consists largely of quotations from older alchemistic writings his other works on alchemy were probably written at an earlier period an english translation of kelley s alchemistic works were published under the editorship of mr a e waite in henry khunrath henry khunrath was born in saxony in the second half of the sixteenth century he was a follower of paracelsus and travelled about germany practising as a physician this german alchemist says mr a e waite is claimed as a hierophant of the psychic side of the magnum opus and was undoubtedly aware of the larger issues of hermetic theorems he describes khunrath s chief work amphitheatrum sapienti tern c as purely mystical and magical a e waite lives of alchemystical philosophers p alexander sethon and michael sendivogius the date and birthplace of alexander sethon a scottish alchemist do not appear to have been recorded but michael sendivogius was probably born in moravia about sethon we are told was in possession of the arch secrets of alchemy he visited holland in proceeded after a time to italy and passed through basle to germany meanwhile he is said to have performed many transmutations ultimately arriving at dresden however he fell into the clutches of the young elector christian ii who in order to extort his secret cast him into prison and put him to the torture but without avail now it so happened that sendivogius who was in quest of the philosopher s stone was staying at dresden and hearing of sethon s imprisonment obtained permission to visit him sendivogius offered to effect sethon s escape in return for assistance in his alchemistic pursuits to which arrangement the scottish alchemist willingly agreed after some considerable outlay of money in bribery sendivogius s plan of escape was successfully carried out and sethon found himself a free man but he refused to betray the high secrets of hermetic philosophy to his rescuer however before his death which occurred shortly afterwards he presented him with an ounce of the transmutative powder sendivogius soon used up this powder we are told in effecting transmutations and cures and being fond of expensive living he married sethon s widow in the hope that she was in the possession of the transmutative secret in this however he was disappointed she knew nothing of the matter but she had the manuscript of an alchemistic work written by her late husband shortly afterwards sendivogius printed at prague a book entitled the new chemical light under the name of cosmopolita which is said to be this work of sethon s but which sendivogius claimed for his own by the insertion of his name on the title page in the form of an anagram the tract on sulphur which was printed at the end of later editions however is said to have been the genuine work of the moravian whilst his powder lasted sendivogius travelled about performing we are told many transmutations he was twice imprisoned in order to extort the secrets of alchemy from him on one occasion escaping and on the other occasion obtaining his release from the emperor rudolph afterwards he appears to have degenerated into an impostor but this is said to have been a finesse to hide his true character as an alchemistic adept he died in see f b lives of

will be found in the rev j b craven s count michael maier life and writings he was a very learned man but his works are somewhat obscure and abound in fanciful allegories he read an alchemistic meaning into the ancient fables concerning the egyptian and greek gods and heroes like most alchemists he held the supposed virtues of mercury in high esteem in his lusus serius or serious passe time for example he supposes a parliament of the various creatures of the world to meet in order that man might choose the noblest of them as king over all the rest the calf the sheep the goose the oyster the bee the silkworm flax and mercury are the chosen representatives each of which discourses in turn it will be unnecessary to state that mercury wins the day thus does maier eulogise it thou art the

rudimentary nature and when his schooling days were over jacob was apprenticed to a shoemaker his religious nature caused him often to admonish his fellow apprentices which behaviour ultimately caused him to be dismissed he travelled about as a journeyman shoemaker returning however to g rlitz in where he married and settled in business he claims to have experienced a wonderful vision in and to have had a similar vision two years later in these visions the first of which lasted for several days he believed that he saw into the inmost secrets of nature but what at first appeared dim and vague became clear and coherent in a third vision which he tells us was vouchsafed to him in it was then that he wrote his first book the aurora which he composed for himself only in order that he should not forget the mysteries disclosed to him at a later period he produced a large number of treatises of a mystical religious nature having spent the intervening years in improving his early education these books aroused the ire of the narrow minded ecclesiastical authorities of the town and jacob suffered considerable persecution in consequence he visited dresden in and in the same year was there taken ill with a fever returning to g rlitz he expired in a condition of ecstasy jacob boehme was an alchemist of a purely transcendental order he had it appears acquired some knowledge of chemistry during his apprentice days and he employed the language of alchemy in the elaboration of his system of mystical philosophy with this lofty mystical religious system we cannot here deal boehme is indeed often accounted the greatest of true christian mystics but although conscious of his superiority over many minor lights we think this title is due to emanuel swedenborg the question of the validity of his visions is also one which lies beyond the scope of the present work we must confine our attention to boehme as an alchemist the philosopher s stone in boehme s terminology is the spirit of christ which must tincture the individual soul in one place he says the phylosophers stone is a very dark disesteemed stone of a gray colour but therein lyeth the highest tincture in the transcendental sense this is reminiscent of the words of isaiah he hath no form nor comeliness and when we see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he was despised and we esteemed him not

he helped to a large extent in the overthrow of the old medical doctrines his purely chemical researches were also of great value to the science he was a man of profound knowledge of a religious temperament and he possessed a marked liking for the mystical he was inspired by the writings of thomas kempis to imitate christ in all things and he practised medicine therefore as a work of benevolence asking no fee for his services at the same time moreover he was a firm believer in the powers of the philosopher s stone claiming to have himself successfully performed the transmutation of the metals on more than one occasion though unacquainted with the composition of the medicine employed see many of his theoretical views are highly fantastical he lived a life devoted to scientific research and died in illustration plate portraits of j b and f m van helmont from the frontispiece to j b van helmont s oriatrike to face page van helmont regarded water as the primary element out of which all things are produced he denied that fire was an element or anything material at all and he did not accept the sulphur mercury salt theory to him is due the word gas before his time various gases were looked upon as mere varieties of air and he also made a distinction between gases which could not be condensed and vapours which give liquids on cooling in particular he investigated the gas that is now known as carbon dioxide carbonic anhydride which he termed gas sylvestre but he lacked suitable apparatus for the collection of gases and hence was led in many cases to erroneous conclusions it has since been discovered that all gases can be condensed given a sufficient degree of cold and pressure francis mercurius van helmont see plate the son of john baptist born in gained

applied chemistry he enriched the science with many important discoveries and crystallised sodium sulphate is still called glauber s salt glauber himself attributed remarkable medicinal powers to this

the living of st bridget s brecknockshire conferred on him during the civil wars he bore arms for the king but his allegiance to the royalist cause led to his being accused of drunkenness swearing incontinency and bearing arms for the king and he appears to have been deprived of his living he retired to oxford and gave himself up to study and chemical research he is to be regarded as an alchemist of the transcendental order his views as to the nature of the true philosopher s stone may be gathered from the following quotation this reader he says speaking of the mystical illumination is the christian philosopher s stone a stone so often inculcated in scripture this is the rock in the wildernesse because in great obscurity and few there are that know the right way unto it this is the stone of fire in ezekiel this is the stone with seven eyes upon it in zacharie and this is the white stone with the new name in the revelation but in the gospel where christ himself speakes who was born to discover mysteries and communicate heaven to earth it is more clearly described at the same time he appears to have carried out experiments in physical alchemy and is said to have met with

treatises of the same author will be found in the hermetic museum some of his views have already been noted see and on certain points he differed from the majority of the alchemists he denied that fire was an element and also that bodies are formed by mixture of the elements according to him there is one principle in the metals namely mercury which arises from the aqueous element and is termed metalically differentiated water i e it is water passed into that stage of development in which it can no longer produce anything but mineral substances philalethes s views as to metallic seed are also of considerable interest of the seed of gold which he regarded as the seed also of all other metals he says the seed of animals and vegetables is something separate and may be cut out or otherwise separately exhibited but metallic seed is diffused throughout the metal and contained in all its smallest parts neither can it be discerned from its body its extraction is therefore a task

alchemists were untiring in their search for the stone of the philosophers and we may well ask whether they ever succeeded in effecting a real transmutation that many apparent transmutations occurred the observers being either self deceived by a superficial examination certain alloys resemble the noble metals or deliberately cheated by impostors is of course undoubted but at the same time we must not assume that because we know not the method now real transmutations have never taken place modern research indicates that it may be possible to transmute other metals such as lead or bismuth into gold and consequently we must admit the possibility that amongst the many experiments carried out a real transmutation was effected on the other hand the method which is suggested by the recent researches in question could not have been known to the alchemists or accidentally employed by them and moreover the quantity of gold which is hoped for should such a method prove successful is far below the smallest amount that would have been detected in the days of alchemy but if there be one method whereby the metals may be transmuted there may be other methods and it is not altogether an easy task to explain away the testimony of eminent men such as were van helmont and helvetius the testimony of van helmont john baptist van helmont see who was celebrated alike for his skill as a physician and chemist and for his nobility of character testified in more than one place that he had himself carried out the transmutation of mercury into gold but as we have mentioned above the composition of the stone employed on these occasions was unknown to him he says for truly i have divers times seen it the stone of the philosophers and handled it with my hands but it was of colour such as is in saffron in its powder yet weighty and shining like unto powdered glass there was once given unto me one fourth part of one grain but i call a grain the six hundredth part of one ounce this quarter of one grain therefore being rouled up in paper i projected upon eight ounces of quick silver made hot in a crucible and straightway all the quick silver with a certain degree of noise stood still from flowing and being congealed setled like unto a yellow lump but after pouring it out the bellows blowing there were found eight ounces and a little less than eleven grains eight ounces less eleven grains of the purest gold therefore one only grain of that powder had transchanged parts of quick silver equal to itself into the best gold j b van helmont life eternal see oriatrike translated by j c or van helmont s workes translated by j c which is merely the former work with a new title page and preliminary matter pp and and again i am constrained to believe that there is the stone which makes gold and which makes silver because i have at distinct turns made projection with my hand of one grain of the powder upon some thousand grains of hot quick silver and the buisiness succeeded in the fire even as books do promise a circle of many people standing by together with a tickling admiration of us all he who first gave me the gold making powder had likewise also at least as much of it as might be sufficient for changing two hundred thousand pounds of gold for he gave me perhaps half a grain of that powder and nine ounces and three quarters of quick silver were thereby transchanged but that gold a strange man a stranger being a friend of one evenings acquaintance gave me j b van helmont the tree of life see oriatrike or van helmont s workes p illustration plate to

colour are worth noticing on the december in the forenoon there came to my house a certain man who was a complete stranger to me but of an honest grave countenance and an authoritative mien clothed in a simple garb like that of a memnonite after we had exchanged salutations he asked me whether he might have some conversation with me he wished to say something to me about the pyrotechnic art as he had read one of my tracts directed against the sympathetic powder of dr digby in which i hinted a suspicion whether the grand arcanum of the sages was not after all a gigantic hoax he therefore took that opportunity of asking me whether i could not believe that such a grand mystery might exist in the nature of things by means of which a physician could restore any patient whose vitals were not irreparably destroyed i answered such a medicine would be a most desirable acquisition for any physician nor can any man tell how many secrets there may be hidden in nature yet though i have read much about the truth of this art it has never been my good fortune to meet with a real master of the alchemical science i also enquired whether he was a medical man in reply he described himself as a brassfounder after some further conversation the artist elias for it was he thus addressed me since you have read so much in the works of the alchemists about this stone its substance its colour and its wonderful effects may i be allowed the question whether you have not yourself prepared it on my answering his question in the negative he took out of his bag a cunningly worked ivory box in which there were three large pieces of a substance resembling glass or pale sulphur and informed me that here was enough of the tincture for the production of tons of gold when i had held the precious treasure in my hand for a quarter of an hour during which time i listened to a recital of its wonderful curative properties i was compelled to restore it to its owner which i could not help doing with a certain degree of reluctance after thanking him for his kindness in shewing it to me i then asked how it was that his stone did not display that ruby colour which i had been taught to regard as characteristic of the philosopher s stone he replied that the colour made no difference and that the substance was sufficiently mature for all practical purposes my request that he would give me a piece of his stone though it were no larger than a coriander seed he somewhat brusquely refused adding in a milder tone that he could not give it me for all the wealth i possessed and that not on account of its great preciousness but for some other reason which it was not lawful for him to divulge helvetius obtains the philosopher s stone when my strange visitor had concluded his narrative i besought him to give me a proof of his assertion by performing the transmutatory operation on some metals in my presence he answered evasively that he could not do so then but that he would return in three weeks and that if he was then at liberty to do so he would shew me something that would make me open my eyes he appeared punctually to the promised day and invited me to take a walk with him in the course of which we discoursed profoundly on the secrets of nature in fire though i noticed that my companion was very chary in imparting information about the grand arcanum at last i asked him point blank to show me the transmutation of metals i besought him to come and dine with me and to spend the night at my house i entreated i expostulated but in vain he remained firm i reminded him of his promise he retorted that his promise had been conditional upon his being permitted to reveal the secret to me at last however i prevailed upon him to give me a piece of his precious stone a piece no larger than a grain of rape seed he delivered it to me as if it were the most princely donation in the world upon my uttering a doubt whether it would be sufficient to tinge more than four grains of lead he eagerly demanded it back i complied in the hope that he would exchange it for a larger piece instead of which he divided it in two with his thumb threw away one half and gave me back the other saying even now it is sufficient for you then i was still more heavily disappointed as i could not believe that anything could be done with so small a particle of the medicine he however bade me take two drachms or half an ounce of lead or even a little more and to melt it in the crucible for the medicine would certainly not tinge more of the base metal than it was sufficient for i answered that i could not believe that so small a quantity of tincture could transform so large a mass of lead but i had to be satisfied with what he had given me and my chief difficulty was about the application of the tincture i confessed that when i held his ivory box in my hand i had managed to extract a few crumbs of his stone but that they had changed my lead not into gold but only into glass he laughed and said that i was more expert at theft than at the application of the tincture you should have protected your spoil with yellow wax then it would have been able to penetrate the lead and to transmute it into gold helvetius performs a transmutation with a promise to return at nine o clock the next morning he left me but at the stated hour on the following day he did not make his appearance in his stead however there came a few hours later a stranger who told me that his friend the artist was unavoidably detained but that he would call at three o clock in the afternoon the afternoon came i waited for him till half past seven o clock he did not appear thereupon my wife came and tempted me to try the transmutation myself i determined however to wait till the morrow and in the meantime ordered my son to light the fire as i was now almost sure that he was an impostor on the morrow however i thought that i might at least make an experiment with the piece of tincture which i had received if it turned out a failure in spite of my following his directions closely i might then be quite certain that my visitor had been a mere pretender to a knowledge of this art so i asked my wife to put the tincture in wax and i myself in the meantime prepared six drachms of lead i then cast the tincture enveloped as it was in wax on the lead as soon as it was melted there was a hissing sound and a slight effervescence and after a quarter of an hour i found that the whole mass of lead had been turned into the finest gold before this transmutation took place the compound became intensely green but as soon as i had poured it into the melting pot it assumed a hue like blood when it cooled it glittered and shone like gold we immediately took it to the goldsmith who at once declared it to be the finest gold he had ever seen and offered to pay fifty florins an ounce for it helvetius s gold assayed the rumour of course spread at once like wildfire through the whole city and in the afternoon i had visits from many illustrious students of this art i also received a call from the master of the mint and some other gentlemen who requested me to place at their disposal a small piece of the gold in order that they might subject it to the usual tests i consented and we betook ourselves to the house of a certain silversmith named brechtil who submitted a small piece of my gold to the test called the fourth three or four parts of silver are melted in the crucible with one part of gold and then beaten out into thin plates upon which some strong aqua fortis nitric acid is poured the usual result of this experiment is that the silver is dissolved while the gold sinks to the bottom in the shape of a black powder and after the aqua fortis has been poured off the gold melted once again in the crucible resumes its former shape when we now performed this experiment we thought at first that one half of the gold had evaporated but afterwards we found that this was not the case but that on the contrary two scruples of the silver had undergone a change into gold helvetius s gold further tested then we tried another test viz that which is performed by means of a septuple of antimony at first it seemed as if eight grains of the gold had been lost but afterwards not only had two scruples of the silver been converted into gold but the silver itself was greatly improved both in quality and malleability thrice i performed this infallible test discovering that every drachm of gold produced an increase of a scruple of gold but the silver is excellent and extremely flexible thus i have unfolded to you the whole story from beginning to end the gold i still retain in my possession but i cannot tell you what has become of the artist elias before he left me on the last day of our friendly intercourse he told me that he was on the point of undertaking a journey to the holy land may the holy angels of god watch over him wherever he is and long preserve him as a source of blessing to christendom this is my earnest prayer on his and our behalf j f helvetius the golden calf ch iii see the hermetic museum vol ii pp et seq testimony such as this warns us not to be too sure that a real transmutation has never taken place on the whole with regard to this question an agnostic position appears to be the more philosophical the genesis of chemistry but even if the alchemists did not discover the grand arcanum of nature they did discover very many scientifically important facts even if they did not prepare the philosopher s stone they did prepare a very large number of new and important chemical compounds their labours were the seeds out of which modern chemistry developed and this highly important science is rightfully included under the expression the outcome of alchemy as we have already pointed out it was the iatro chemists who first investigated chemical matters with an object other than alchemistic their especial end in view being the preparation of useful medicines though the medical chemist and the alchemist were very often united in the one person as in the case of paracelsus himself and the not less famous van helmont it was not until still later that chemistry was recognised as a distinct science separate from medicine the degeneracy of alchemy in another direction the outcome of alchemy was of a very distressing nature alchemy was in many respects eminently suitable as a cloak for fraud and those who became alchemists with the sole object of accumulating much wealth in a short space of time finding that the legitimate pursuit of the art did not enable them to realise their expectations in this direction availed themselves of this fact there is indeed some evidence that the degeneracy of alchemy had commenced as early as the fourteenth century but the attainment of the magnum opus was regarded as possible for some three or more centuries the alchemistic promises of health wealth and happiness and a pseudo mystical style of language were effectively employed by these impostors some more or less ingenious tricks such as the use of hollow stirring rods in which the gold was concealed c convinced a credulous public of the validity of their claims of these pseudo alchemists we have already made the acquaintance of edward kelley but chief of them all is generally accounted the notorious count cagliostro that cagliostro is rightfully placed in the category of pseudo alchemists is certain but it also appears equally certain that charlatan though he was posterity has not always done him that justice which is due to all men however bad they may be count cagliostro of the birth and early life of the personage calling himself count cagliostro nothing is known with any degree of certainty even his true name being enveloped in mystery it has indeed been usual to identify him with the notorious italian swindler giuseppe balsamo who born at palermo in or apparently disappeared from mortal ken after some thirty years of which the majority were spent in committing various crimes cagliostro s latest biographer who appears to have gone into the matter very thoroughly however throws very grave doubts on the truth of this theory w r h trowbridge cagliostro the splendour and misery of a master of magic we must acknowledge our indebtedness for many of the particulars which follow to this work it is however unfortunately marred by a ridiculous attempt to show a likeness between cagliostro and swedenborg for which by the way mr trowbridge has already been criticised by the spectator it may justly be said of swedenborg that he was scrupulously honest and sincere in his beliefs as well as in his actions and as a philosopher it is only now being discovered how really great he was he did indeed claim to have converse with spiritual beings but the results of modern psychical research have robbed such claims of any inherent impossibility and in swedenborg s case there is very considerable evidence for their validity illustration plate to face page if the earlier part of cagliostro s life is unknown the latter part is so overlaid with legends and lies that it is almost impossible to get at the truth concerning it in cagliostro and his wife were in london where cagliostro became a freemason joining a lodge connected with the order of strict observance a secret society incorporated with freemasonry and which on the continent at least was concerned largely with occult subjects cagliostro however was unsatisfied with its rituals and devised a new system which he called egyptian masonry egyptian masonry he taught was to reform the whole world and he set out leaving england for the continent to convert masons and others to his views we must look for the motive power of his extraordinary career in vanity and a love of mystery mongering without any true knowledge of the occult it is probable indeed that ultimately his unbounded vanity triumphed over his reason and that he actually believed in his own pretensions that he did possess hypnotic and clairvoyant powers is we think at least probable but it is none the less certain that when such failed him he had no scruples against employing other means of convincing the credulous of the validity of his claims this was the case on his visit to russia which occurred not long afterwards at st petersburg a youthful medium he was employing to put the matter briefly gave the show away and at warsaw where he found it necessary to turn alchemist he was detected in the process of introducing a piece of gold in the crucible containing the base metal he was about to transmute at strasburg which he reached in however he was more successful here he appeared as a miraculous healer of all diseases though whether his cures are to be ascribed to some simple but efficacious medicine which he had discovered to hypnotism to the power of the imagination on the part of his patients or to the power of imagination on the part of those who have recorded the alleged cures is a question into which we do not propose to enter at strasburg cagliostro came into contact with the cardinal de rohan and a fast friendship sprang up between the two which in the end proved cagliostro s ruin the count next visited bordeaux and lyons successfully founding lodges of egyptian masonry from the latter town he proceeded to paris where he reached the height of his fame he became extraordinarily rich although he is said to have asked and to have accepted no fee for his services as a healer on the other hand there was a substantial entrance fee to the mysteries of egyptian masonry which with its alchemistic promises of health and wealth prospered exceedingly at the summit of his career however fortune forsook him as a friend of de rohan he was arrested in connection with the diamond necklace affair on the word of the infamous countess de lamotte although of whatever else he may have been guilty he was perfectly innocent of this charge after lying imprisoned in the bastille for several months he was tried by the french parliament pronounced innocent and released immediately however the king banished him and he left paris for london where he seems to have been persistently persecuted by agents of the french king he returned to the continent ultimately reaching italy where he was arrested by the inquisition and condemned to death on the charge of being a freemason a dire offence in the eyes of the roman catholic church the sentence however was modified to one of perpetual imprisonment and he was confined in the castle of san leo where he died in after four years of imprisonment in what manner is not known chapter vi the age of modern chemistry the birth of modern chemistry chemistry as distinct from alchemy and iatro chemistry commenced with robert boyle see plate who first clearly recognised that its aim is neither the transmutation of the metals nor the preparation of medicines but the observation and generalisation of a certain class of phenomena who denied the validity of the alchemistic view of the constitution of matter and enunciated the definition of an element which has since reigned supreme in chemistry and who enriched the science with observations of the utmost importance boyle however was a man whose ideas were in advance of his times and intervening between the iatro chemical period and the age of modern chemistry proper came the period of the phlogistic theory a theory which had a certain affinity with the ideas of the alchemists illustration plate portrait of robert boyle to face page the phlogiston theory the phlogiston theory was mainly due to georg ernst stahl becher had attempted to revive the once universally accepted sulphur mercury salt theory of the alchemists in a somewhat modified form by the assumption that all substances consist of three earths the combustible mercurial and vitreous and herein is to be found the germ of stahl s phlogistic theory according to stahl all combustible bodies including those metals that change on heating contain phlogiston the principle of combustion which escapes in the form of flame when such substances are burned according to this theory therefore the metals are compounds since they consist of a metallic calx what we now call the oxide of the metal combined with phlogiston and further to obtain the metal from the calx it is only necessary to act upon it with some substance rich in phlogiston now coal and charcoal are both almost completely combustible leaving very little residue hence according to this theory they must consist very largely of phlogiston and as a matter of fact metals can be obtained by heating their calces with either of these substances many other facts of a like nature were explicable in terms of the phlogiston theory and it became exceedingly popular chemists at this time did not pay much attention to the balance it was observed however that metals increased in weight on calcination but this was explained on the assumption that phlogiston possessed negative weight antoine lavoisier utilising priestley s discovery of oxygen called dephlogisticated air by its discoverer and studying the weight relations accompanying combustion demonstrated the non validity of the phlogistic theory and proved combustion to be the combination of the substance burnt with a certain constituent of the air the oxygen by this time alchemy was to all intents and purposes defunct boerhave was the last eminent chemist to give any support to its doctrines and the new chemistry of lavoisier gave it a final death blow we now enter upon the age of modern chemistry but we shall deal in this chapter with the history of chemical theory only so far as is necessary in pursuance of our primary object and hence our account will be very far from complete it should be noted however that if by the term phlogiston we were to understand energy and not some form of matter most of the statements of the phlogistics would be true so far as they go boyle and the definition of an element robert boyle had defined an element as a substance which could not be decomposed but which could enter into combination with other elements giving compounds capable of decomposition into these original elements hence the metals were classed among the elements since they had defied all attempts to decompose them now it must be noted that this definition is of a negative character and although it is convenient to term elements all substances which have so far defied decomposition it is a matter of impossibility to decide what substances are true elements with absolute certainty and the possibility however faint that gold and other metals are of a compound nature and hence the possibility of preparing gold from the base metals or other substances must always remain this uncertainty regarding the elements appears to have generally been recognised by the new school of chemists but this having been so it is the more surprising that their criticism of alchemistic art was not less severe the stoichiometric laws with the study of the relative weights in which substances combine certain generalisations or natural laws of supreme importance were discovered these stoichiometric laws as they are called are as follows the law of constant proportion the same chemical compound always contains the same elements and there is a constant ratio between the weights of the constituent elements present the law of multiple proportions if two substances combine chemically in more than one proportion the weights of the one which combine with a given weight of the other stand in a simple rational ratio to one another the law of combining weights substances combine either in the ratio of their combining numbers or in simple rational multiples or submultiples of these numbers the weights of different substances which combine with a given weight of some particular substance which is taken as the unit are called the combining numbers of such substances with reference to this unit the usual unit now chosen is grammes of oxygen in order that these laws may hold good it is of course necessary that the substances are weighed under precisely similar conditions to state these laws in a more absolute form we can replace the term weight by mass or in preference inertia for the inertias of bodies are proportional to their weights providing that they are weighed under precisely similar conditions for a discussion of the exact significance of these terms mass and inertia the reader is referred to the present writer s matter spirit and the cosmos rider chapter i on the doctrine of the indestructibility of matter as examples of these laws we may take the few following simple facts pure water is found always to consist of oxygen and hydrogen combined in the ratio of parts by weight of the latter to parts by weight of the former and pure sulphur dioxide to take another example is found always to consist of sulphur and oxygen combined in the ratio of parts by weight of sulphur to parts by weight of oxygen the law of constant proportion another compound is known consisting only of oxygen and hydrogen which however differs entirely in its properties from water it is found always to consist of oxygen and hydrogen combined in the ratio of parts by weight of the latter to parts by weight of the former i e in it a definite weight of hydrogen is combined with an amount of oxygen exactly twice that which is combined with the same weight of hydrogen in water no definite compound has been discovered with a constitution intermediate between these two other compounds consisting only of sulphur and oxygen are also known one of these viz sulphur trioxide or sulphuric anhydride is found always to consist of sulphur and oxygen combined in the ratio of parts by weight of sulphur to parts by weight of oxygen we see therefore that the weights of sulphur combined with a definite weight of oxygen in the two compounds called respectively sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide are in the proportion of to i e similar simple ratios are obtained in the case of all the other compounds the law of multiple proportions from the data given in above we can fix the combining number of hydrogen as that of sulphur as now compounds are known containing sulphur and hydrogen and in each case the weight of sulphur combined with grammes of hydrogen is found always to be either grammes or some multiple or submultiple of this quantity thus in the simplest compound of this sort containing only hydrogen and sulphur viz sulphuretted hydrogen or hydrogen sulphide grammes of hydrogen is found always to be combined with grammes of sulphur i e exactly twice the above quantity the law of combining weights berthollet denied the truth of the law of constant proportion and a controversy ensued between this chemist and proust who undertook a research to settle the question the results of which were in entire agreement with the law and were regarded as completely substantiating it illustration plate by worthington after allen portrait of john dalton to face page dalton s atomic theory at the beginning of the nineteenth century john dalton see plate put forward his atomic theory in explanation of these facts this theory assumes that all matter is made up of small indivisible and indestructible particles called atoms that all atoms are not alike there being as many different sorts of atoms as there are elements that the atoms constituting any one element are exactly alike and are of definite weight and that compounds are produced by the combination of different atoms now it is at once evident that if matter be so constituted the stoichiometric laws must necessarily follow for the smallest particle of any definite compound now called a molecule must consist of a definite assemblage of different atoms and these atoms are of definite weight whence the law of constant proportion one atom of one substance may combine with atoms of some other substance but it cannot combine with some fractional part of an atom since the atoms are indivisible whence the law of multiple proportions and these laws holding good and the atoms being of definite weight the law of combining weights necessarily follows dalton s atomic theory gave a simple and intelligible explanation of these remarkable facts regarding the weights of substances entering into chemical combination and therefore gained universal acceptance but throughout the history of chemistry can be discerned a spirit of revolt against it as an explanation of the absolute constitution of matter the tendency of scientific philosophy has always been towards monism as opposed to dualism and here were not merely two eternals but several dozen dalton s theory denied the unity of the cosmos it lacked the unifying principle of the alchemists it is only in recent times that it has been recognised that a scientific hypothesis may be very useful without being altogether true as to the usefulness of dalton s theory there can be no question it has accomplished that which no other hypothesis could have done it rendered the concepts of a chemical element a chemical compound and a chemical reaction definite and has in a sense led to the majority of the discoveries in the domain of chemistry that have been made since its enunciation but as an expression of absolute truth dalton s theory as is very generally recognised nowadays fails to be satisfactory in the past however it has been the philosophers of the materialistic school of thought rather than the chemists qu chemists who have insisted on the absolute truth of the atomic theory kekul who by developing franklin s theory of atomicity or valency made still more definite the atomic view of matter himself expressed grave doubts as to the absolute truth of dalton s theory but he regarded it as chemically true and thus voices what appears to be the opinion of the majority of chemists nowadays namely there are such things as chemical atoms and chemical elements incapable of being decomposed by purely chemical means but that such are not absolute atoms or absolute elements and consequently not impervious to all forms of action but of this more will be said later the term valency is not altogether an easy one to define we will however here do our best to make plain its significance in a definite chemical compound we must assume that the atoms constituting each molecule are in some way bound together though not of course rigidly and we may speak of bonds or links of affinity taking care however not to interpret such terms too literally now the number of affinity links which one atom can exert is not unlimited indeed according to the valency theory as first formulated it is fixed and constant it is this number which is called the valency of the element but it is now known that the valency in most cases can vary between certain limits hydrogen however appears to be invariably univalent and is therefore taken as the unit of valency thus carbon is quadrivalent in the methane molecule which consists of one atom of carbon combined with four atoms of hydrogen and oxygen is divalent in the water molecule which consists of one atom of oxygen combined with two atoms of hydrogen hence we should expect to find one atom of carbon combining with two of oxygen which is the case in the carbon dioxide carbonic anhydride molecule for a development of the thesis so far as the compounds of carbon are concerned that each specific affinity link corresponds in general to a definite and constant amount of energy which is evolved as heat on disruption of the bond the reader is referred to the present writer s monograph on the calculation of thermo chemical constants arnold the phenomena of valency find their explanation in modern views concerning the constitution of atoms see the determination of the atomic weights of the elements with the acceptance of dalton s atomic theory it became necessary to determine the atomic weights of the various elements i e not the absolute atomic weights but the relative weights of the various atoms with reference to one of them as unit we cannot in this place enter upon a discussion of the various difficulties both of an experimental and theoretical nature which were involved in this problem save to remark that the correct atomic weights could be arrived at only with the acceptance of avogadro s hypothesis this hypothesis which is to the effect that equal volumes of different gases measured at the same temperature and pressure contain an equal number of gaseous molecules was put forward in explanation of a number of facts connected with the physical behaviour of gases but its importance was for some time unrecognised owing to the fact that the distinction between atoms and molecules was not yet clearly drawn a list of those chemical substances at present recognised as elements together with their atomic weights will be found on pp since hydrogen is the lightest of all known substances the unit hydrogen was at one time usually employed however it was seen to be more convenient to express the atomic weights in terms of the weight of the oxygen atom and the unit oxygen is now always employed this value for the oxygen atom was chosen so that the approximate atomic weights would in most cases remain unaltered by the change prout s hypothesis it was observed by a chemist of the name of prout that the atomic weight of hydrogen being taken as the unit the atomic weights of nearly all the elements approximated to whole numbers and in he suggested as the reason for this regularity that all the elements consist solely of hydrogen prout s hypothesis received on the whole a very favourable reception it harmonised dalton s theory with the grand concept of the unity of matter all matter was hydrogen in essence and thomas thomson undertook a research to demonstrate its truth on the other hand however the eminent swedish chemist berzelius who had carried out many atomic weight determinations criticised both prout s hypothesis and thomson s research which latter it is true was worthless in most severe terms for the hypothesis amounted to this that the decimals in the atomic weights obtained experimentally by berzelius after so much labour were to be regarded as so many errors in marignac suggested half the hydrogen atom as the unit for the element chlorine with an atomic weight of would not fit in with prout s hypothesis as originally formulated and later dumas suggested one quarter with this theoretical division of the hydrogen atom the hypothesis lost its simplicity and charm and was doomed to downfall recent and most accurate atomic weight determinations show clearly that the atomic weights are not exactly whole numbers but that nevertheless the majority of them if expressed in terms of o as the unit do approximate very closely to such the hon r j strutt has recently calculated that the probability of this occurring in the case of certain of the commoner elements by mere chance is exceedingly small about in and several attempts to explain this remarkable fact have been put forward modern scientific speculations concerning the constitution of atoms tend towards a modified form of prout s hypothesis or to the view that the atoms of other elements are in a manner polymerides of hydrogen and helium atoms as has been pointed out it is possible according to modern views for elements of different atomic weight to have identical chemical properties since these latter depend only upon the number of free electrons in the atom and not at all upon the massive central nucleus by a method somewhat similar to that used for determining the mass of kathode particles see but applied to positively charged particles sir joseph thomson and dr f w aston discovered that the element neon was a mixture of two isotopic elements in unequal proportions one having an atomic mass of the other present only to a slight extent having an atomic mass of dr aston has perfected this method of analysing mixtures of isotopes and determining their atomic masses the results are of great interest the atomic weight of hydrogen is confirmed the elements helium carbon nitrogen oxygen fluorine phosphorus sulphur arsenic iodine and sodium are found to be simple bodies with whole number atomic weights on the other hand boron neon silicon chlorine bromine krypton xenon mercury lithium potassium and rubidium are found to be mixtures what is specially of interest is that the indicated atomic mass of each of the constituents is a whole number thus chlorine whose atomic weight is is found to be a mixture of two chemically identical elements whose atomic weights are and some of the elements e g xenon are mixtures of more than two isotopes hon r j strutt on the tendency of the atomic weights to approximate to whole numbers philosophical magazine vol i pp et seq f w aston mass spectra and atomic weights journal of the chemical society vol cix pp et seq it is highly probable that what is true of the elements investigated by dr aston is true of the remainder it appears therefore that the irregularities presented by the atomic weights of the ordinary elements which have so much puzzled men of science in the past are due to the fact that these elements are in many cases mixtures as concerns hydrogen it is only reasonable to suppose that the close packing of electrically charged particles should give rise to a slight decrease in their total mass so that the atomic weights of other elements referred to h should be slightly less than whole numbers or what is the same thing that the atomic weight of hydrogen referred to o should be slightly more than unity the periodic law a remarkable property of the atomic weights was discovered in the sixties independently by lothar meyer and mendel eff they found that the elements could be arranged in rows in the order of their atomic weights so that similar elements would be found in the same columns a modernised form of the periodic table will be found on pp it will be noticed for example that the alkali metals lithium sodium rubidium and c sium which resemble one another very closely fall in column the alkaline earth metals occur together in column though in each case these are accompanied by certain elements with somewhat different properties much the same holds good in the case of the other columns of this table there is manifested a remarkable regularity with certain still more remarkable divergences see notes appended to table on pp this regularity exhibited by the elements is of considerable importance since it shows that in general the properties of the elements are periodic functions of their atomic weights and together with certain other remarkable properties of the elements distinguishes them sharply from the compounds it may be concluded with tolerable certainty therefore that if the elements are in reality of a compound nature they are all in general compounds of a like nature distinct from that of other compounds the periodic table of the chemical elements hydro hydro gen a gen h h helium lithium gluci

atomic weights given are those of the international atomic weights committee for they are calculated on the basis oxygen the number of decimal places given in each case indicates the degree of accuracy with which each atomic weight has been determined the letter or letters underneath the name of each element is the symbol by which it is invariably designated by chemists the number above each column indicates the valency which the elements of each group exhibit towards oxygen many of the elements are exceptional in this respect a the exact position of hydrogen is in dispute b the positions of argon and potassium have been inverted in order that these elements may fall in the right columns with the elements they resemble d so also have the positions of tellurium and iodine c the whole of group forms an exception to the table e there are a number of ill defined rare earth metals with atomic weights lying between those of cerium and tantalum they all appear to resemble the elements of group so that their positions in the table cannot be decided with accuracy it is now some years since the late sir william crookes attempted to explain the periodicity of the properties of the elements on the theory that they have all been evolved by a conglomerating process from some primal stuff the protyle consisting of very small particles he represented the action of this generative cause by means of a figure of eight spiral along which the elements are placed at regular intervals so that similar elements come underneath one another as in mendel eff s table though the grouping differs in some respects the slope of the curve is supposed to represent the decline of some factor e g temperature conditioning the process which process is assumed to be of a recurrent nature like the swing of a pendulum after the completion of one swing to keep to the illustration of a pendulum whereby one series of elements is produced owing to the decline of the above mentioned factor the same series of elements is not again the result as would otherwise be the case but a somewhat different series is produced each member of which resembles the corresponding member of the former series thus if the first series contains for example helium lithium carbon c the second series will contain instead argon potassium titanium c the whole theory though highly interesting is however by no means free from defects the corpuscular theory of matter we must now turn our attention to those recent views of the constitution of matter which originated to a great extent in the investigations of the passage of electricity through gases at very low pressures it will be possible however on the present occasion to give only the very briefest account of the subject but a fuller treatment is rendered unnecessary by the fact that these and allied investigations and the theories to which they have given rise have been fully treated in several well known works by various authorities on the subject which have appeared during the last few years we have found prof harry jones the electrical nature of matter and radioactivity mr soddy s radioactivity and mr whetham s the recent development of physical science particularly interesting mention of course should also be made of the standard works of prof sir j j thomson and prof rutherford when an electrical discharge is passed through a high vacuum tube invisible rays are emitted from the kathode generally with the production of a greenish yellow fluorescence where they strike the glass walls of the tube these rays are called kathode rays at one time they were regarded as waves in the ether but it was shown by sir william crookes that they consist of small electrically charged particles moving with a very high velocity sir j j thomson was able to determine the ratio of the charge carried by these particles to their mass or inertia he found that this ratio was constant whatever gas was contained in the vacuum tube and much greater than the corresponding ratio for the hydrogen ion electrically charged hydrogen atom in electrolysis by a skilful method based on the fact discovered by mr c t r wilson that charged particles can serve as nuclei for the condensation of water vapour he was further able to determine the value of the electrical charge carried by these particles which was found to be constant also and equal to the charge carried by univalent ions e g hydrogen in electrolysis hence it follows that the mass of these kathode particles must be much smaller than the hydrogen ion the actual ratio being about the first theory put forward by sir j j thomson in explanation of these facts was that these kathode particles corpuscles as he termed them were electrically charged portions of matter much smaller than the smallest atom and since the same sort of corpuscle is obtained whatever gas is contained in the vacuum tube it is reasonable to conclude that the corpuscle is the common unit of all matter proof that the electrons are not matter this eminent physicist however had shown mathematically that a charged particle moving with a very high velocity approaching that of light would exhibit an appreciable increase in mass or inertia due to the charge the magnitude of such inertia depending on the velocity of the particle this was experimentally verified by kaufmann who determined the velocities and the ratios between the electrical charge and the inertia of various kathode particles and similar particles which are emitted by compounds of radium see and sir j j thomson calculated these values on the assumption that the inertia of such particles is entirely of electrical origin and thereby obtained values in remarkable agreement with the experimental there is therefore no reason for supposing the corpuscle to be matter at all indeed if it were the above agreement would not be obtained as professor jones says since we know things only by their properties and since all the properties of the corpuscle are accounted for by the electrical charge associated with it why assume that the corpuscle contains anything but the electrical charge it is obvious that there is no reason for doing so the corpuscle is then nothing but a disembodied electrical charge containing nothing material as we have been accustomed to use that term it is electricity and nothing but electricity with this new conception a new term was introduced and now instead of speaking of the corpuscle we speak of the electron applying this modification to the above view of the constitution of matter we have what is called the electronic theory namely that the material atoms consist of electrons or units of electricity in rapid motion which amounts to this that matter is simply an electrical phenomenon h c jones the electrical nature of matter and radioactivity p the electronic theory of matter sir j j thomson has elaborated this theory of the nature and constitution of matter he has shown what systems of electrons would be stable and has attempted to find therein the significance of mendel eff s generalisation and the explanation of valency there can be no doubt that there is a considerable element of truth in the electronic theory of matter the one characteristic property of matter i e inertia can be accounted for electrically the fundamental difficulty is that the electrons are units of negative electricity whereas matter is electrically neutral several theories have been put forward to surmount this difficulty certainly the electron is a constituent of matter but is it the sole constituent recent research indicates that as already pointed out all atoms consist of two distinct portions a massive central nucleus whose net charge is positive surrounded by a number of electrons just sufficient to neutralize this charge the point of greatest interest is that the indicated number of free electrons is exactly the number which expresses the position of the element in the periodic table reckoning helium as lithium as and so on and it would seem that the chemical properties of the elements are determined entirely by these electrons and are therefore not strictly speaking periodic functions of their atomic weights as was formerly thought but of their atomic numbers the exact nature of the nuclei of the various atoms has yet to be determined in the case of the atoms heavier than helium they would appear to be made up of the nuclei of hydrogen and or helium atoms together with in many cases electrons insufficient in number to neutralize the positive charges associated with these the etheric theory of matter the analysis of matter has been carried a step further a philosophical view of the cosmos involves the assumption of an absolutely continuous and homogeneous medium filling all space for an absolute vacuum is unthinkable and if it were supposed that the stuff filling all space is of an atomic structure the question arises what occupies the interstices between its atoms this ubiquitous medium is termed by the scientists of to day the ether of space moreover such a medium as the ether is demanded by the phenomena of light it appears however that the ether of space has another and a still more important function than the transmission of light the idea that matter has its explanation therein has been developed by sir oliver lodge the evidence certainly points to the conclusion that matter is some sort of singularity in the ether probably a stress centre we have been too much accustomed to think of the ether as something excessively light and quite the reverse of massive or dense in which it appears we have been wrong sir oliver lodge calculates that the density of the ether is far greater than that of the most dense forms of matter not that matter is to be thought of as a rarefaction of the ether for the ether within matter is as dense as that without what we call matter however is not a continuous substance it consists rather of a number of widely separated particles whence its comparatively small density compared with the perfectly continuous ether further if there is a difficulty in conceiving how a perfect fluid like the ether can give rise to a solid body possessed of such properties as rigidity impenetrability and elasticity we must remember that all these properties can be produced by means of motion a jet of water moving with a sufficient velocity behaves like a rigid and impenetrable solid whilst a revolving disc of paper exhibits elasticity and can act as a circular saw it appears therefore that the ancient doctrine of the alchemistic essence is fundamentally true after all that out of the one thing all material things have been produced by adaptation or modification and as we have already noticed there also appears to be some resemblance between the concept of the electron and that of the seed of gold which seed it should be borne in mind was regarded by the alchemists as the common seed of all metals see sir oliver lodge f r s the ether of space further evidence of the complexity of the atoms there are also certain other facts which appear to demand such a modification of dalton s atomic theory as is found in the electronic theory one of the characteristics of the chemical elements is that each one gives a spectrum peculiar to itself the spectrum of an element must therefore be due to its atoms which in some way are able at a sufficiently high temperature to act upon the ether so as to produce vibrations of definite and characteristic wave length now in many cases the number of lines of definite wave length observed in such a spectrum is considerable for example hundreds of different lines have been observed in the arc spectrum of iron but it is incredible that an atom if it were a simple unit would give rise to such a number of different and definite vibrations and the only reasonable conclusion is that the atoms must be complex in structure we may here mention that spectroscopic examination of various heavenly bodies leads to the conclusion that there is some process of evolution at work building up complex elements from simpler ones since the hottest nebul appear to consist of but a few simple elements whilst cooler bodies exhibit a greater complexity views of wald and ostwald such modifications of the atomic theory as those we have briefly discussed above although profoundly modifying and indeed controverting the philosophical significance of dalton s theory as originally formulated leave its chemical significance practically unchanged the atoms can be regarded no longer as the eternal indissoluble gods of nature that they were once supposed to be thus materialism is deprived of what was thought to be its scientific basis but the science of chemistry is unaffected thereby the atoms are not the ultimate units out of which material things are built but the atoms cannot be decomposed by purely chemical means the elements are not truly elemental but they are chemical elements however the atomic theory has been subjected to a far more searching criticism wald argues that substances obey the law of definite proportions because of the way in which they are prepared chemists refuse he says to admit any substance as a definite chemical compound unless it does obey this law wald s opinions have been supported by professor ostwald who has attempted to deduce the other stoichiometric laws on these grounds without assuming any atomic hypothesis but these new ideas do not appear to have gained the approval of chemists in general it is not to be supposed that chemists will give up without a struggle a mental tool of such great utility as dalton s theory in spite of its defects has proved itself to be there does seem however to be logic in the arguments of wald and ostwald but the trend of recent scientific theory and research does not appear to be in the direction of wald s views certainly however it appears that on the one hand the atomic theory is not necessitated by the so called stoichiometric laws but on the other hand a molecular constitution of matter seems to be demanded by the phenomenon known as the brownian movement i e the spontaneous irregular and apparently perpetual movement of microscopic portions of solid matter when immersed in a liquid medium such movement appearing to be explicable only as the result of the motion of the molecules of which the liquid in question is built up for a critical examination of materialism the reader is referred to

mysticism is dead or that men no longer seek to apply the principles of mysticism to phenomena on the physical plane but they do so after another manner from that of the alchemists a new science however is born amongst us closely related on the one hand to chemistry on the other to physics but dealing with changes more profound and reactions more deeply seated than are dealt with by either of these a science as yet without a name unless it be the not altogether satisfactory one of radioactivity it is this science or perhaps we should say a certain aspect of it to which we refer it may be fantastically by the expression modern alchemy the aptness of the title we hope to make plain in the course of the present chapter x rays and becquerel rays as is commonly known what are called x rays are produced when an electric discharge is passed through a high vacuum tube it has been shown that these rays are a series of irregular pulses in the ether which are set up when the kathode particles strike the walls of the glass vacuum tube and it was found that more powerful effects can be produced by inserting a disc of platinum in the path of the kathode particles it was m becquerel who first discovered that there are substances which naturally emit radiations similar to x rays he found that uranium compounds affected a photographic plate from which they were carefully screened and he also showed that these uranium radiations or becquerel rays resemble x rays in other particulars it was already known that certain substances fluoresce emit light in the dark after having been exposed to sunlight and it was thought at first that the above phenomenon exhibited by uranium salts was of a like nature since certain uranium salts are fluorescent but m becquerel found that uranium salts which had never been exposed to sunlight were still capable of affecting a photographic plate and that this remarkable property was possessed by all uranium salts whether fluorescent or not this phenomenon is known as radioactivity and bodies which exhibit it are said to be radioactive schmidt found that thorium compounds possess a similar property and professor rutherford showed that thorium compounds evolved also something resembling a gas he called this an emanation they must not be confused with the greenish yellow phosphorescence which is also produced the x rays are invisible the discovery of radium mme curie determined the radioactivity of many uranium and thorium compounds and found that there was a proportion between the radioactivity of such compounds and the quantity of uranium or thorium in them with the remarkable exception of certain natural ores which had a radioactivity much in excess of the normal and indeed in certain cases much greater than pure uranium in order to throw some light on this matter mme curie prepared one of these ores by a chemical process and found that it possessed a normal radioactivity the only logical conclusion to be drawn from these facts was that the ores in question must contain some unknown highly radioactive substance and the curies were able after very considerable labour to extract from pitchblende the ore with the greatest radioactivity minute quantities of the salts of two new elements which they named polonium and radium respectively both of which were extremely radioactive see madame sklodowska curie s radio active substances nd ed m debierne has obtained a third radioactive substance from pitchblende which he has called actinium chemical properties of radium radium is an element resembling calcium strontium and barium in chemical properties its atomic weight was determined by mme curie and found to be about according to her first experiments a redetermination gave a slightly higher value which has been confirmed by a further investigation carried out by sir t e thorpe radium gives a characteristic spectrum and is intensely radioactive it should be noted that up to the middle of the year the element radium itself had not been prepared in all the experiments carried out radium salts were employed i e certain compounds of radium with other elements generally radium chloride and radium bromide in that year however mme curie in conjunction with m debierne obtained the free metal it is described as a white shining metal resembling the other alkaline earth metals it reacts very violently with water chars paper with which it is allowed to come in contact and blackens in the air probably owing to the formation of a nitride it fuses at c and is more volatile than barium see sir

the chemical news vol cii p the radioactivity of radium radium salts give off three distinct sorts of rays referred to by the greek letters the rays have been shown to consist of electrically charged positive particles with a mass approximately equal to that of four hydrogen atoms they are slightly deviated by a magnetic field and do not possess great penetrative power the rays are similar to the kathode rays and consist of negative electrons they are strongly deviated by a magnetic field in a direction opposite to that in which the particles are deviated and possess medium penetrative power passing for the most part through a thin sheet of metal the rays resemble x rays they possess great penetrative power and are not deviated by a magnetic field the difference in the effect of the magnetic field on these rays and the difference in their penetrative power led to their detection and allows of their separate examination radium salts emit also an emanation which tends to become occluded in the solid salt but can be conveniently liberated by dissolving the salt in water or by heating it the emanation exhibits the characteristic properties of a gas it obeys boyle s law i e its volume varies inversely with its pressure and it can be condensed to a liquid at low temperatures its density as determined by the diffusion method is about attempts to prepare chemical compounds of the emanation have failed and in this respect it resembles the rare gases of the atmosphere helium neon argon krypton and xenon whence it is probable that its molecules are monatomic so that a density of would give its atomic weight as as can be seen from the table on pp an atomic weight of about corresponds to a position in the column containing the rare gases in the periodic system that the emanation actually has an atomic weight of these dimensions was confirmed by further experiments carried out by the late sir william ramsay and dr r w gray these chemists determined the density of the emanation by actually weighing minute quantities of known volume of the substance sealed up in small capillary tubes a specially sensitive balance being employed values for the density varying from to corresponding to values for the atomic weight varying from to were thereby obtained sir william ramsay therefore considered that there could no longer be any doubt that the emanation was one of the elements of the group of chemically inert gases he proposed to call it niton and for reasons which we shall note later considered that in all probability it had an atomic weight of about this follows from avogadro s hypothesis see sir william ramsay and dr r w gray la densit de l manation du radium comptes rendus hebdomadaires des s ances de l acad mie des sciences vol cvi pp et seq the disintegration of the radium atom radium salts possess another very remarkable property namely that of continuously emitting light and heat it seemed at first that here was a startling contradiction to the law of the conservation of energy but the whole mystery becomes comparatively clear in terms of the corpuscular or the electronic theory of matter the radium atom is a system of a large number see of corpuscles or electrons and contains in virtue of their motion an enormous amount of energy but it is known from chemistry that atomic systems i e molecules which contain very much energy are unstable and liable to explode the same law holds good on the more interior plane the radium atom is liable to and actually does explode and the result energy is set free and manifests itself partly as heat and light some free electrons are shot off the rays which striking the undecomposed particles of salt give rise to pulses in the ether the rays just as the kathode particles give rise to x rays when they strike the walls of the vacuum tube or a platinum disc placed in their path the and rays do not however result immediately from the exploding radium atoms the initial products being the emanation and one particle from each radium atom destroyed this view regarding the rays is not however universally accepted some scientists regarding them as consisting of a stream of particles moving with very high velocities induced radioactivity radium salts have the property of causing surrounding objects to become temporally radioactive this induced radioactivity as it may be called is found to be due to the emanation which is itself radioactive it emits rays only and is decomposed into minute traces of solid radioactive deposits by examining the rate of decay of the activity of the deposit it has been found that it is undergoing a series of sub atomic changes the products being termed radium a b c c it has been proved that all the and rays emitted by radium salts are really due to certain of these secondary products radium f is thought to be identical with polonium another product is also obtained by these decompositions with which we shall deal later properties of uranium and thorium uranium and thorium differ in one important respect from radium inasmuch as the first product of the decomposition of the uranium and thorium atoms is in both cases solid sir william crookes was able to separate from uranium salts by chemical means a small quantity of an intensely radioactive substance which he called uranium x the residual uranium having lost most of its activity and m becquerel on repeating the experiment found that the activity of the residual uranium was slowly regained whilst that of the uranium x decayed this is most simply explained by the theory that uranium first changes into uranium x it has been suggested that radium may be the final product of the breaking up of the uranium atom at any rate it is quite certain that radium must be evolved in some way as otherwise there would be none in existence it would all have decomposed this suggestion has been experimentally confirmed the growth of radium in large quantities of a solution of purified uranyl nitrate having been observed uranium gives no emanation thorium probably gives at least three solid products meso thorium radio thorium and thorium x the last of which yields an emanation resembling that obtained from radium but not identical with it sir william crookes f r s radio activity of uranium proceedings of the royal society of london vol lxvi pp et seq the radium emanation we must now more fully consider the radium emanation a substance with more astounding properties than even the radium compounds themselves by distilling off the emanation from some radium bromide and measuring the quantities of heat given off by the emanation and the radium salt respectively professors rutherford and barnes proved that nearly three fourths of the total amount of heat given out by a radium salt comes from the minute quantity of emanation that it contains the amount of energy liberated as heat during the decay of the emanation is enormous one cubic centimetre liberates about four million times as much heat as is obtained by the combustion of an equal volume of hydrogen undoubtedly this must indicate some profound change and one may well ask what is the ultimate product of the decomposition of the emanation e rutherford f r s and h t barnes d sc heating effect of the radium emanation philosophical magazine vol vii pp et seq the production of helium from radium it had been observed already that the radioactive minerals on heating give off helium a gaseous element characterised by a particular yellow line in its spectrum and it seemed not unlikely that helium might be the ultimate decomposition product of the emanation a research to settle this point was undertaken by sir william ramsay and mr soddy and a preliminary experiment having confirmed the above speculation they carried out further very careful experiments the maximum amount of the emanation obtained from milligrams of radium bromide was conveyed by means of oxygen into a u tube cooled in liquid air and the latter was then extracted by the pump the spectrum was observed it was apparently a new one probably that of the emanation itself after standing from july to the helium spectrum appeared and the characteristic lines were observed sir william ramsay performed a further experiment with a similar result in which the radium salt had been first of all heated in a vacuum for some time proving that the helium obtained could not have been occluded in it though the fact that the helium spectrum did not immediately appear in itself proves this point sir william ramsay s results were confirmed by further careful experiments by sir james dewar and other chemists it was suggested therefore that the particle consists of an electrically charged helium atom and not only is this view in agreement with the value of the mass of this particle as determined experimentally but it has been completely demonstrated by professor rutherford and mr royds these chemists performed an experiment in which the emanation from about one seventh of a gramme of radium was enclosed in a thin walled tube through the walls of which the particles could pass but which were impervious to gases this tube was surrounded by an outer jacket which was evacuated after a time the presence of helium in the space between the inner tube and the outer jacket was observed spectroscopically now the emanation atom results from the radium atom by the expulsion of one particle and since this latter consists of an electrically charged helium atom it follows that the emanation must have an atomic weight of i e this value is in agreement with sir william ramsay s determination of the density of the emanation we may represent the degradation of the radium atom therefore by the following scheme

nature of this change here then for the first time in the history of chemistry we have the undoubted formation of one chemical element from another for leaving out of the question the nature of the emanation there can be no doubt that radium is a chemical element this is a point which must be insisted upon for it has been suggested that radium may be a compound of helium with some unknown element or perhaps a compound of helium with lead since it has been shown that lead is probably one of the end products of the decomposition of radium the following considerations however show this view to be altogether untenable i all attempts to prepare compounds of helium with other elements have failed ii radium possesses all the properties of a chemical element it has a characteristic spectrum and falls in that column in the periodic table with those elements which it resembles as to its chemical properties iii the quantity of heat liberated on the decomposition of the emanation is as we have already indicated out of all proportion to that obtained even in the most violent chemical reactions and iv one very important fact has been observed namely that the rate of decay of the emanation is unaffected by even extreme changes of temperature whereas chemical actions are always affected in rate by changes of temperature it will also be advisable perhaps to indicate some of the differences between helium and the emanation the latter is a heavy gas condensable to a liquid by liquid air recently it has been solidified whereas helium is the lightest of all known gases with the exception of hydrogen and has been liquefied only by the most persistent effort the emanation moreover is radioactive giving off particles whereas helium does not possess this property by ramsay see proceedings of the chemical society vol xxv pp and by professor onnes see chemical news vol xcviii p july is this change a true transmutation it has been pointed out however that in a sense this change viz of emanation into helium is not quite what has been meant by the expression transmutation of the elements for the reason that it is a spontaneous change no effort of ours can bring it about or cause it to cease but the fact of the change does go to prove that the chemical elements are not the discrete units of matter that they were supposed to be and since it appears that all matter is radioactive although save in these exceptional cases in a very slight degree we here have evidence of a process of evolution at work among the chemical elements the chemical elements are not permanent they are all undergoing change and the common elements merely mark those points where the rate of the evolutionary process is at its slowest see also and thus the essential truth in the old alchemistic doctrine of the growth of metals is vindicated for the metals do grow in the womb of nature although the process may be far slower than appears to have been imagined by certain of the alchemists and although gold may not be the end product as writes professor sir w tilden it appears that modern ideas as to the genesis of the elements and hence of all matter stand in strong contrast with those which chiefly prevailed among experimental philosophers from the time of newton and seem to reflect in an altered form the speculative views of the ancients it seems probable he adds that the chemical elements and hence all material substances of which the earth the sea the air and the host of heavenly bodies are all composed resulted from a change corresponding to condensation in something of which we have no direct and intimate knowledge some have imagined this primal essence of all things to be identical with the ether of space as yet we know nothing with certainty but it is thought that by means of the spectroscope some stages of the operation may be seen in progress in the nebul and stars we have next to consider whether there is any experimental evidence showing it to be possible using the phraseology of the alchemists for man to assist in nature s work see professor h c jones the electrical nature of matter and radioactivity pp it has been definitely proved for example that the common element potassium is radioactive though very feebly so it emits rays it is also interesting to note that many common substances emit corpuscles at high temperatures says peter bonus however we know that the generation of metals occupies thousands of years in nature s workshop see the new pearl of great price mr a e waite s translation p and certain others of the alchemists expressed a similar view sir william a tilden the elements speculations as to their nature and origin pp and with regard to sir william tilden s remarks it is very interesting to note that swedenborg who was born when newton was between forty and fifty years old not only differed from that great philosopher on those very points on which modern scientific philosophy is at variance with newton but as is now recognised by scientific men anticipated many modern discoveries and scientific theories it would be a most interesting task to set forth the agreement existing between swedenborg s theories and the latest products of scientific thought concerning the nature of the physical universe such however would lie without the confines of the present work the production of neon from emanation as we have already indicated above the radium emanation contains a vast store of potential energy and it was with the idea of utilising this energy for bringing about chemical changes that sir william ramsay undertook a research on the chemical action of this substance a research with the most surprising and the most interesting results for the energy contained within the radium emanation appeared to behave like a veritable philosopher s stone the first experiments were carried out on distilled water it had already been observed that the emanation decomposes water into its gaseous elements oxygen and hydrogen and that the latter is always produced in excess these results were confirmed and the presence of hydrogen peroxide was detected explaining the formation of an excess of hydrogen it was also shown that the emanation brings about the reverse change to some extent causing oxygen and hydrogen to unite with the production of water until a position of equilibrium is attained on examining spectroscopically the gas obtained by the action of the emanation on water after the removal of the ordinary gases a most surprising result was observed the gas showed a brilliant spectrum of neon accompanied with some faint helium lines a more careful experiment was carried out later by sir william ramsay and mr cameron in which a silica bulb was employed instead of glass the spectrum of the residual gas after removing ordinary gases was successfully photographed and a large number of the neon lines identified helium was also present the presence of neon could not be explained in ramsay s opinion by leakage of air into the apparatus as the percentage of neon in the air is not sufficiently high whereas this suggestion might be put forward in the case of argon moreover the neon could not have come from the aluminium of the electrodes in which it might be thought to have been occluded as the sparking tube had been used and tested before the experiment was carried out the authors conclude we must regard the transformation of emanation into neon in presence of water as indisputably proved and if a transmutation be defined as a transformation brought about at will by change of conditions then this is the first case of transmutation of which conclusive evidence is put forward however professor rutherford and mr royds have been unable to confirm this result they describe attempts to obtain neon by the action of emanation on water out of five experiments no neon was obtained save in one case in which a small air leak was discovered and since the authors find that very minute quantities of this gas are sufficient to give a clearly visible spectrum they conclude that ramsay s positive results are due after all to leakage of air into the apparatus but if this is the true explanation of ramsay s results it is difficult to understand why in the case of the experiment with a solution of a copper salt described below the presence of neon was not detected for if due to leakage the proportions of the rare gases present should presumably have been the same in all the experiments further research seems necessary conclusively to settle the question sir

water was decomposed by the emanation suggested to sir william ramsay and mr cameron that if a solution of a metallic salt was employed in place of pure water the free metal might be obtained these modern alchemists therefore proceeded to investigate the action of radium emanation on solutions of copper and lead salts and again apparently effected transmutations they found on removing the copper from a solution of a copper salt which had been subjected to the action of the emanation and spectroscopically examining the residue that a considerable quantity of sodium was present together with traces of lithium and the gas evolved in the case of a solution of copper nitrate contained along with much nitric oxide and a little nitrogen argon which was detected spectroscopically but no helium it certainly seemed like a dual transformation of copper into lithium and sodium and emanation into argon they also observed that apparently carbon dioxide is continually evolved from an acid solution of thorium nitrate see below it is worth while noticing that helium neon and argon occur in the same column in the periodic table with emanation lithium and sodium with copper and carbon with thorium in each case the elements produced being of lighter atomic weight than those decomposed the authors make the following suggestions that helium and the particle are not identical that helium results from the degradation of the large molecule of emanation by its bombardment with particles that this degradation when the emanation is alone or mixed with oxygen and hydrogen results in the lowest member of the inactive series namely helium that if particles of greater mass than hydrogen or oxygen are associated with the emanation namely liquid water then the degradation of the emanation is less complete and neon is produced that when molecules of still greater weight and complexity are present as is the case when the emanation is dissolved in a solution of copper sulphate the product of degradation of the emanation is argon we are inclined to believe too they say that the copper also is involved in this process of degradation and is reduced to the lowest term of its series namely lithium and at the same time inasmuch as the weight of the residue of alkali produced when copper nitrate is present is double that obtained from the blank experiment or from water alone the supposition is not excluded that the chief product of the degradation of copper is sodium see pp journal of the chemical society vol xci pp more recent experiments however proved that the particle does consist of an electrically charged helium atom and this view was latterly accepted by sir william ramsay so that the above suggestions must be modified in accordance therewith see further experiments on radium and copper a little later madame curie and mademoiselle gleditsch repeated cameron and ramsay s experiments on copper salts using however platinum apparatus they failed to detect lithium after the action of the emanation and think that cameron and ramsay s results may be due to the glass vessels employed dr perman has investigated the direct action of the emanation on copper and gold and has failed to detect any trace of lithium the transmutation of copper into lithium therefore must be regarded as unproved but further research is necessary before any conclusive

chemical society vol xxiv p ramsay s experiments on thorium and allied metals in his presidential address to the chemical society march after having brought forward some exceedingly interesting arguments for the possibility of transmutation sir william ramsay described some experiments which he had carried out on thorium and allied elements it was found as we have already stated that apparently carbon dioxide was continually evolved from an acid solution of thorium nitrate precautions being taken that the gas was not produced from the grease on the stop cock employed and it also appeared that carbon dioxide was produced by the action of radium emanation on thorium nitrate the action of radium emanation on compounds not containing carbon of other members of the carbon group namely silicon zirconium and lead was then investigated in the cases of zirconium nitrate and hydro fluosilicic acid carbon dioxide was obtained but in the case of lead chlorate the amount of carbon dioxide was quite insignificant curiously enough the perchlorate of bismuth a metal which belongs to the nitrogen group of elements also yielded carbon dioxide when acted on by emanation sir william ramsay concludes his discussion of these experiments as follows such are the facts no one is better aware than i how insufficient the proof is many other experiments must be made before it can confidently be asserted that certain elements when exposed to concentrated energy undergo degradation into carbon some such confirmatory experiments were carried out by sir william ramsay and mr francis l usher and they also described an experiment with a compound of titanium their results confirm sir william ramsay s former experiments carbon dioxide was obtained in appreciable quantities by the action of emanation on compounds of silicon titanium zirconium and thorium in the case of lead the amount of carbon dioxide obtained was inappreciable sir william ramsay elements and electrons journal of the chemical society vol xcv pp et seq for a brief account in english of these later experiments see the chemical news vol c p october the possibility of making gold it does not seem unlikely that if it is possible to degrade elements it may be possible to build them up it has been suggested that it might be possible to obtain in this way gold from silver since these two elements occur in the same column in the periodic table but the suggestion still awaits experimental confirmation the question arises what would be the result if gold could be cheaply produced that gold is a metal admirably adapted for many purposes for which its scarcity prevents its use must be admitted but the financial chaos which would follow if it were to be cheaply obtained surpasses the ordinary imagination it is a theme that ought to appeal to a novelist of exceptional imaginative power however we need not fear these results for not only is radium extremely rare far dearer than gold and on account of its instability will never be obtained in large quantities but judging from the above described experiments if indeed the radium emanation is the true philosopher s stone the quantity of gold that may be hoped for by its aid is extremely small the significance of allotropy a very suggestive argument for the transmutation of the metals was put forward by professor henry m howe ll d in a paper entitled allotropy or transmutation read before the british association section b sheffield meeting certain substances are known which although differing in their physical properties very markedly behave chemically as if they were one and the same element giving rise to the same series of compounds such substances of which we may mention diamond graphite and charcoal e g lampblack all of which are known chemically as carbon or to take another example yellow phosphorus a yellow waxy highly inflammable solid and red phosphorus a difficultly inflammable dark red substance probably possessing a minutely crystalline structure are moreover convertible one into the other it has been customary to refer to such substances as different forms or allotropic modifications of the same element and not to regard them as being different elements as professor howe says if after defining elements as substances hitherto indivisible and different elements as those which differ in at least some one property and after asserting that the elements cannot be transmuted into each other we are confronted with the change from diamond into lampblack and with the facts first that each is clearly indivisible hitherto and hence an element and second that they differ in every property we try to escape in a circle by saying that they are not different elements because they do change into each other in short we limit the name element to indivisible substances which cannot be transmuted into each other and we define those which do transmute as ipso facto one element and then we say that the elements cannot be transmuted is not this very like saying that if you call a calf s tail a leg then a calf has five legs and if it is just to reply that calling a tail a leg does not make it a leg is it not equally just to reply that calling two transmutable elements one element does not make them so diamond is transformed into graphite when heated by a powerful electric current between carbon poles and both diamond and graphite can be indirectly converted into charcoal the artificial production of the diamond however is a more difficult process but the late professor moissan succeeded in effecting it so far as very small diamonds are concerned by dissolving charcoal in molten iron or silver and allowing it to crystallise from the solution under high pressure graphite was also obtained red phosphorus is produced from yellow phosphorus by heating the latter in absence of air the temperature c is the most suitable at higher temperatures the reverse change sets in red phosphorus being converted into yellow phosphorus is it philosophical to point to the fact that two such transmutable elements yield but a single line of derivatives as proof that they are one element is not this rather proof of the readiness indeed irresistibleness of their transmutation does not this simply mean that the derivativeless element whenever it enters into combination inevitably transmutes into its mate which has derivatives professor henry m howe ll d allotropy or transmutation see the chemical news vol cii pp and september according to the atomic theory the differences between what are termed allotropic modifications are generally ascribed to differences in the number and arrangement of the atoms constituting the molecules of such modifications and not to any differences in the atoms themselves but we cannot argue that two such allotropic modifications or elements which are transmutable into one another are one and the same element because they possess the same atomic weight and different elements are distinguished by different atomic weights for the reason that in the determination of atomic weights derivatives of such bodies are employed hence the value obtained is the atomic weight of the element which forms derivatives from which that of its derivativeless mate may differ considerably for all we know to the contrary if we do indeed regard the atomic weights of the elements as having any meaning beyond expressing the inertia ratios in which they combine one with another if we wish to distinguish between two such allotropic modifications apart from any theoretical views concerning the nature and constitution of matter we can say that such modifications are different because equal weights of them contain or are equivalent to different quantities of energy since the change of one form to another takes place only with the evolution or absorption as the case may be of heat but according to modern views regarding the nature of matter this is the sole fundamental difference between two different elements such are different because equal weights of them contain or are equivalent to different quantities of energy the so called allotropic modifications of an element therefore are just as much different elements as any other different elements and the change from one modification to another is a true transmutation of the elements the only distinction being that what are called allotropic modifications of the same element differ only slightly in respect of the energy they contain and hence are comparatively easy to convert one into the other whereas different elements so called differ very greatly from one another in this respect whence it is to be concluded that the transmutation of one such element into another will only be attained by the utilisation of energy in a very highly concentrated form such as is evolved simultaneously with the spontaneous decomposition of the radium emanation for a defence of the view that chemical substances may be regarded as energy complexes and that this view is equally as valid as the older notion of a chemical substance as an inertia complex i e as something made up entirely of different units or atoms each characterised by the possession of a definite and constant weight at a fixed point on the earth s surface see an article by the present writer entitled the claims of thermochemistry knowledge and scientific news vol vii new series pp et seq july in some cases the heat change accompanying the transformation of an element into an allotropic modification can be measured directly more frequently however it is calculated as the difference between the quantities of heat obtained when the two forms are converted into one and the same compound conclusion we have shown that modern science indicates the essential truth of alchemistic doctrine and our task is ended writing in sir william ramsay said if these hypotheses concerning the possibility of causing the atoms of ordinary elements to absorb energy are just then the transmutations of the elements no longer appears an idle dream the philosopher s stone will have been discovered and it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that it may lead to that other goal of the philosophers of the dark ages the elixir vit for the action of living cells is also dependent on the nature and direction of the energy which they contain and who can say that it will be impossible to control their action when the means of imparting and controlling energy shall have been investigated whatever may be the final verdict concerning his own experiments those of sir ernest rutherford referred to in the preface to the present edition demonstrate the fact of transmutation and it is worth noticing how many of the alchemists obscure descriptions of their magistery well apply to that marvellous something which we call energy the true first matter of the universe and of the other problem the elixir vit who knows
